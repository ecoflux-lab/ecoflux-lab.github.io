::: 
::::

I am broadly interested in the impacts of climate variability and land-use change on land-atmosphere exchanges of water, energy, and trace gases. I also seek to understand how ecosystem responses to global change can feedback to slow or accelerate future climate change. My research and training is in micrometeorology, hydrology, and ecosystem ecology. I focus on biosphere-atmosphere interactions in a variety of climates and ecosystems.

Office| MCML 137

::: 
::::

I am responsible for management of numerous research and equipment design projects for various faculties and departments at UBC. I design eddy covariance and soil respiration systems that are used at various North American universities as well as by other research institutions. My main research interests are (1) the design of automated measurement systems for long-term environmental measurements and (2) the standardization of measurement and data processing procedures to ensure high quality and reproducibility of research results.

**Education**
: B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade
: M.A.Sc. in Electrical Engineering, University of British Columbia

::: 
::::

I am interested in studying the carbon and water cycle in different ecosystems (forest, urban vegetation and wetlands) using observations such as eddy covariance, sap flow and remote sensing techniques. My research includes understanding the responses of carbon and water dynamics with the land cover change, management activities and climate change (drought and heatwave).

: Indian Institute of Remote sensing, India, Masters

Name| Tzu-Yi Lu
Level of Study| Ph.D. Candidate

:::
::::

I received my MS in Geography from National Taiwan University in 2017. I am interested in understanding the response of the wetland ecosystem to climate change, especially in quantifying the net exchange of carbon. My previous research investigated the relationship between environmental controls and CO2 flux in low-latitude wetland ecosystems, applying an Artificial Neural Network technique to simulate the variance of carbon exchange by meteorological variables.

::::

I earned an MS in Environmental Science from Western Washington University in 2016 and continued at WWU as a Research Associate for several years. My previous research has focused primarily on blue carbon, studying soil carbon sequestration rates in Pacific Northwest estuaries and in United Arab Emirates mangroves, in addition to monitoring and modeling vegetation and sediment dynamics in relation to estuary restoration and sea level rise. I am currently interested in studying greenhouse gas fluxes in Pacific Northwest tidal wetlands -- particularly how they respond to ecosystem restoration and climate change -- to ultimately better understand the value of tidal wetland management actions as natural climate solutions.

::: 
::::

I received a BS in Biological Sciences from Wellesley College in 2017, then worked as an ecosystem ecology field technician and research assistant before moving to Vancouver. I am interested in land-atmosphere carbon dynamics and am particularly interested in quantifying the terrestrial carbon sink. My research at UBC involves modeling greenhouse gas fluxes from restored tidal wetlands in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.

::::
  
I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Geography/Environmental Studies from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2019. Before coming to UBC, I worked as a scientific programmer at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, providing visualization and computation support to earth system and atmosphere climate models. I am interested in modelling land-atmosphere exchanges and projecting responses of wetland and forested ecosystems to climate change.
