I am broadly interested in the impacts of climate variability and land-use change on land-atmosphere exchanges of water, energy, and trace gases. I also seek to understand how ecosystem responses to global change can feedback to slow or accelerate future climate change. My research and training is in micrometeorology, hydrology, and ecosystem ecology. I focus on biosphere-atmosphere interactions in a variety of climates and ecosystems.

I am responsible for management of numerous research and equipment design projects for various faculties and departments at UBC. I design eddy covariance and soil respiration systems that are used at various North American universities as well as by other research institutions. My main research interests are (1) the design of automated measurement systems for long-term environmental measurements and (2) the standardization of measurement and data processing procedures to ensure high quality and reproducibility of research results.

I have worked as a Research Associate and leader in research and development strategies for over a decade, on a variety of research topics spanning numerical weather prediction and meteorology across multiple scales. My focus shifted to climate science when I joined the EcoFlux Lab in March 2024. Currently, I am working on standardizing eddy-covariance data from flux towers in Canadian wetlands, with the larger goal of evaluating the role of wetlands as a natural climate solution.

Name| Dr. Paul Moore
Position | Data Scientist

::: 
::::

My research has focused on understanding the ecohydrological feedbacks in boreal wetland ecosystems. My approach has incorporated both field-based methods such as eddy covariance and lab-based experiments to parameterize physically-based ecosystem models. The aim of the modelling has been to test our conceptual understanding of ecosystem processes, but also to define thresholds of disturbance which significantly impact ecosystem function under a range of current and future climate scenarios. My current research efforts are focused on supporting eddy covariance deployment, data processing, and analysis.

I am interested in studying the carbon and water cycle in different ecosystems (forest, urban vegetation and wetlands) using observations such as eddy covariance, sap flow and remote sensing techniques. My research includes understanding the responses of carbon and water dynamics with the land cover change, management activities and climate change (drought and heatwave).

Level of Study| Ph.D. Candidate

:::
::::

I received my MS in Geography from National Taiwan University in 2017. I am interested in understanding the response of the wetland ecosystem to climate change, especially in quantifying the net exchange of carbon. My previous research investigated the relationship between environmental controls and CO2 flux in low-latitude wetland ecosystems, applying an Artificial Neural Network technique to simulate the variance of carbon exchange by meteorological variables.

I earned an MS in Environmental Science from Western Washington University in 2016 and continued at WWU as a Research Associate for several years. My previous research has focused primarily on blue carbon, studying soil carbon sequestration rates in Pacific Northwest estuaries and in United Arab Emirates mangroves, in addition to monitoring and modeling vegetation and sediment dynamics in relation to estuary restoration and sea level rise. I am currently interested in studying greenhouse gas fluxes in Pacific Northwest tidal wetlands -- particularly how they respond to ecosystem restoration and climate change -- to ultimately better understand the value of tidal wetland management actions as natural climate solutions.

I received a BS in Biological Sciences from Wellesley College in 2017, then worked as an ecosystem ecology field technician and research assistant before moving to Vancouver. I am interested in land-atmosphere carbon dynamics and am particularly interested in quantifying the terrestrial carbon sink. My research at UBC involves modeling greenhouse gas fluxes from restored tidal wetlands in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.

I am a PhD candidate at the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Currently, I am doing research at McGill University as a visiting student. I am interested in the basic characteristics of the wetland carbon cycle and the main environmental response features. At the present stage, my research focuses on quantifying the environmental response characteristics of methane emissions from wetlands, and based on this, I am trying to construct models to quantify methane emissions and further reduce the simulation errors.

I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Geography/Environmental Studies from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2019. Before coming to UBC, I worked as a scientific programmer at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, providing visualization and computation support to earth system and atmosphere climate models. I am interested in modelling land-atmosphere exchanges and projecting responses of wetland and forested ecosystems to climate change.

I received my B.Sc. in Environment from McGill in 2024, specialising in Land Surface Processes and Environmental Change. Before coming back to McGill for my Master's, I worked 9 months in Science and Conservation Planning at the Nature Conservancy of Canada. I am interested in quantifying land-atmosphere greenhouse gas fluxes from wetlands and how they are altered after degradation and restoration. I believe understanding this missing piece of the puzzle can help to better value and protect wetland ecosystems and their role as nature-based climate solutions.
