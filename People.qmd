I am broadly interested in the impacts of climate variability and land-use change on land-atmosphere exchanges of water, energy, and trace gases. I also seek to understand how ecosystem responses to global change can feedback to slow or accelerate future climate change. My research and training is in micrometeorology, hydrology, and ecosystem ecology. I focus on biosphere-atmosphere interactions in a variety of climates and ecosystems.

I am responsible for management of numerous research and equipment design projects for various faculties and departments at UBC. I design eddy covariance and soil respiration systems that are used at various North American universities as well as by other research institutions. My main research interests are (1) the design of automated measurement systems for long-term environmental measurements and (2) the standardization of measurement and data processing procedures to ensure high quality and reproducibility of research results.

I am a non-binary geographer, researcher, and educator and my pronouns are they/them/theirs. I have been living as an uninvited guest on unceded Coast Salish Territory since 2015.  I received a PhD in Geography from the University of British Columbia in 2022. My research focuses on using micrometeorology, remote sensing, spatial analysis, and machine learning to understand ecosystem-scale carbon fluxes. I am particularly interested in climate feedback mechanisms which either exacerbate or can help mitigate climate change.

I received my MS in Geography from National Taiwan University in 2017. I am interested in understanding the response of the wetland ecosystem to climate change, especially in quantifying the net exchange of carbon. My previous research investigated the relationship between environmental controls and CO2 flux in low-latitude wetland ecosystems, applying an Artificial Neural Network technique to simulate the variance of carbon exchange by meteorological variables.

I earned an MS in Environmental Science from Western Washington University in 2016 and continued at WWU as a Research Associate for several years. My previous research has focused primarily on blue carbon, studying soil carbon sequestration rates in Pacific Northwest estuaries and in United Arab Emirates mangroves, in addition to monitoring and modeling vegetation and sediment dynamics in relation to estuary restoration and sea level rise. I am currently interested in studying greenhouse gas fluxes in Pacific Northwest tidal wetlands -- particularly how they respond to ecosystem restoration and climate change -- to ultimately better understand the value of tidal wetland management actions as natural climate solutions.

I received a BS in Biological Sciences from Wellesley College in 2017, then worked as an ecosystem ecology field technician and research assistant before moving to Vancouver. I am interested in land-atmosphere carbon dynamics and am particularly interested in quantifying the terrestrial carbon sink. My research at UBC involves modeling greenhouse gas fluxes from restored tidal wetlands in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.

Prior to UBC, while at the University of Minnesota, I earned a BS in Computer Science (1997), then a MS (2000) and PhD in Geophysics (2006) under David Kohlstedt, investigating the dynamic properties of partially molten peridotites. My work helped constrain the composition and behavior of highly molten planetary interiors such as Jupiter’s moon Io. I then worked at Microsoft for several years as a data scientist and engineer, and more recently as a high-school science and math teacher. My current research interests include studying greenhouse gas fluxes in wetland environments. I then synthesize the data collected across multiple sites in various environments to better understand how individually and collectively they can contribute as a natural climate solution. As in my prior PhD, I hope my work can be used to better constrain climate models and lead to sound policy as we address climate change. In my free time, I enjoy trail running and rock climbing.

I received a BSc in Atmospheric Science from the University of British Columbia in 2021. I have spent research terms at UBC studying effects of climate change on intertidal ecology, cloud microphysics and precipitation modelling, and methane emission hotspots in wetlands. I'm interested in investigating environmental drivers of land-atmosphere greenhouse gas exchange and how they might respond to changing climate conditions. During my MSc, I plan to further examine the controls of wetland methane emissions and better understand how we can effectively manage wetlands as natural climate solutions.

I received a BSc in Environmental Science from the University of British Columbia in 2022. My undergraduate thesis research investigated the impacts of fire on greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes (CO2, CH4, and N2O) within different burned zones of a bog. The methodology incorporated chamber measurements and gas chromatography for the analysis. Currently, as a second-year MSc student, I am examining the impacts of seedling removal — a post-fire management practice — on the GHG fluxes (CO2 and CH4) within the 2016 burned zone of the Burns Bog, Delta, BC. This research utilizes a smart chamber with a portable analyzer. Additionally, I am interested in quantifying the net carbon exchange at the ecosystem scale using eddy covariance techniques and understanding carbon dynamics across varying ecosystem types.

I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Geography/Environmental Studies from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2019. Before coming to UBC, I worked as a scientific programmer at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, providing visualization and computation support to earth system and atmosphere climate models. I am interested in modelling land-atmosphere exchanges and projecting responses of wetland and forested ecosystems to climate change.

I am currently doing a B.Sc in Geographical Sciences, with concentrations in Climatology and Geographic Information Systems. Within the lab, I am supporting various graduate students with their research on how wetland and tidal sites can act as natural climate solutions, where I will help to write code for data processing, and assist on field site visits. I hope in later years to conduct more research on land-atmosphere exchanges, specifically around the carbon cycle, and find ways to incorporate different GIS technologies to help in visualizing it.

I am an undergraduate student at UBC majoring in Geographical Sciences with a concentration in climatology. My work in the lab consists of facilitating graduate students with their research and field visits to the flux towers. I am currently working with Zoe Zhang to pursue further research on the effects of heatwaves on carbon dioxide and methane fluxes at restored peatlands. In the near future, I am interested in studying how greenhouse gas exchange is influenced by varying biophysical and meteorological factors.
