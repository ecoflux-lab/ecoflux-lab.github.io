	abstract = {Abstract Rewetting of disturbed peatlands is an important restoration strategy for climate change mitigation. Previous work primarily focuses on the biogeochemical processes altered by rewetting and few studies have investigated the biophysical impacts, which can diminish or amplify biogeochemical effects beyond the ecosystem scale. We used a paired flux tower approach in a restored peatland to collect year-round eddy covariance data to assess the biophysical impacts of disturbance and management practices. The first site was actively rewetted and is characterized by Sphagnum and white beak-rush with patches of open water. The second site represents a disturbed ecosystem, which underwent natural regeneration and is dominated by scrub pine, Sphagnum, and low shrubs. We found that the actively restored site had higher net radiation compared to the second site due to more surface water ponding; however, the higher aerodynamic conductance at the passively restored site contributed to enhanced daytime turbulent fluxes, and hence, both sites had similar aerodynamic temperatures during the daytime. The actively restored site experienced warmer nighttime and seasonal aerodynamic temperature as much of the excess radiation during the day was stored in the water column and released at night. To achieve restoration goals, higher water tables are now maintained throughout large sections of the bog. The study implies that water table manipulation has the potential to minimize greenhouse gas emissions from the bog, thereby allowing the biophysical impacts of peatland restoration to enhance the biogeochemical benefits. Therefore, it is important to consider both biophysical and biogeochemical changes in peatland restoration management.},
