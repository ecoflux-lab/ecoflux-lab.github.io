	abstract = {Quantifying the emissions of the three main biogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4), from agroecosystems is crucial. In this study continuous measurements of N2O, and CH4 emissions from potato and pea crops in southwest British Columbia, Canada were made using the eddy-covariance (EC) technique. Flux footprint analysis, coupled with EC and manual nonsteady state chamber measurements, was used to address the spatial heterogeneity resulting from the field edge at the study site. Flux footprint corrections had a larger effect on N2O fluxes than CO2 fluxes because of a more pronounced difference in N2O fluxes between the crop and edge areas. After flux footprint corrections, the potato and pea crops were both weak CO2 sinks with annual net ecosystem exchange values of −57 ± 9 and −97 ± 16 g C m−2 yr−1, respectively. However, after taking carbon (C) export via crop harvest and C import via seeding into account, the potato crop shifted to being a moderate C source of 284 ± 55 g C m−2 yr−1, while the pea crop became near C neutral, sequestering only 30 ± 26 g C m−2 yr−1. Annual GHG balances, quantified by converting N2O and CH4 to CO2 equivalents as pulse emissions using respective global warming potentials on a 100-year timescale, were 417 ± 88 and 152 ± 106 g CO2e m−2 yr−1 for the potato and pea crops, respectively, with N2O contributing the largest proportion to annual total GHG balances and outweighing the CO2 uptake from the atmosphere.},

	abstract = {Peatland drainage depletes large carbon stocks by increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the soil. Restoration via re-wetting could play an important role in climate change mitigation, reducing CO2 emissions and increasing C storage within peatlands. However, re-wetting leads to a biogeochemical compromise between increased CO2 uptake, and enhanced methane (CH4) release. The extent of this compromise in re-wetted ecosystems with differing environmental conditions is uncertain. To assess re-wetting effects, we analyzed eddy-covariance flux measurements from a temperate bog near Vancouver, Canada, from two sites that have undergone different restoration techniques. By the end of the 1-year study period, the actively re-wetted, wetter site, was a weak CO2 sink (−26.1 ± 6.1 g C-CO2 m−2), and the passively re-wetted, drier site, was near CO2 neutral (3.8 ± 3.1 g C-CO2 m−2). Higher CH4 emissions at the wetter site led to a larger radiative balance on 20- and 100-year time horizons, implying that the strong radiative effect of CH4 can offset CO2 sink strength on shorter to medium timeframes. However, long-term radiative forcing (RF) modeling suggests sustained CO2 uptake by the wetter site will eventually lead to a cooling effect on the climate. Furthermore, modeling results emphasize that despite both re-wetted peatland sites having a positive RF over century timescales, the lack of restoration would have resulted in a significantly larger RF beyond the first few decades following restoration. Results highlight the importance of actively re-wetting disturbed peatlands to mitigate climate warming and can be used to inform management decisions.},

	abstract = {Tidal marshes sequester 11.4–87.0 Tg C yr−1 globally, but climate change impacts can threaten the carbon capture potential of these ecosystems. Tidal marshes occur across a wide range of salinity, with brackish marshes (0.5–18 ppt (parts per thousand)) dominating global tidal marsh extents. A diverse mix of freshwater- and saltwater-tolerant plant and microbial communities has led researchers to predict that carbon cycling in brackish wetlands may be less sensitive to changes in salinity than fresh- or saltwater wetlands. Rush Ranch, a well-monitored brackish tidal wetland of the San Francisco Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, experiences highly variable annual salinity regimes. Within a five-year period (2014–2018), Rush Ranch experienced particularly extreme drought-induced salinization during the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons. During drought years, tidal channel salinity rose from a 15 year baseline of 4.7 ppt to growing season peaks of 10.3 ppt and 12.5 ppt. Continuous eddy covariance data from 2014 to 2018 demonstrate that during drought summers, gross primary productivity (GPP) decreased by 24\%, whereas ecosystem respiration remained similar among all five years. Stepwise linear regression revealed that salinity, not air temperature or tidal height, was the dominant driver of annual GPP. A random forest model trained to predict GPP based on environmental data from low salinity years (i.e. naive to salinization) significantly over predicted GPP in drought years. When growing season salinities were doubled, annual estimates of net ecosystem exchange of CO2 decreased by up to 30\%. These results provide ecosystem-scale evidence that increased salinity influences CO2 fluxes dominantly through reductions in GPP. This relationship provides a starting point for incorporating the effect of changes in salinity in wetland carbon models, which could improve wetland carbon forecasting and management for climate resilience.},

	abstract = {Area burned, number of fires, seasonal fire severity, and fire season length are all expected to increase in Canada, with largely unquantified ecosystem feedbacks. However, there are few observational studies measuring ecosystem-scale biogeochemical (e.g., carbon dioxide exchanges) and biophysical (e.g., energy partitioning) properties during smoke episodes and hence assessing responses of gross primary production (GPP) to changes in incoming diffuse photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). In this study, we leveraged two long-term eddy covariance measurement sites in forest and wetland ecosystems to study four smoke episodes, which happened at different times and differed in length, over 4 different years (2015, 2017, 2018, and 2020). We found that the highest decrease in shortwave irradiance due to smoke was about 50 \% in July and August but increased to about 90 \% when the smoke arrived in September. When the smoke arrived in the later stage of summer, impacts on sensible and latent heat fluxes were very different than the earlier ones. Smoke generally increased the diffuse fraction (DF) from ∼ 0.30 to ∼ 0.50 and turned both sites into stronger carbon dioxide (CO2) sinks with increased GPP up to ∼ 18 \% and ∼ 7 \% at the forest and wetland site, respectively. However, when DF exceeded 0.80 as a result of dense smoke, both ecosystems became net CO2 sources as total PAR dropped to low values. The results suggest that this kind of natural experiment is important for validating future predictions of smoke–productivity feedbacks.},

	abstract = {Rewetting of disturbed peatlands is an important restoration strategy for climate change mitigation. Previous work primarily focuses on the biogeochemical processes altered by rewetting and few studies have investigated the biophysical impacts, which can diminish or amplify biogeochemical effects beyond the ecosystem scale. We used a paired flux tower approach in a restored peatland to collect year-round eddy covariance data to assess the biophysical impacts of disturbance and management practices. The first site was actively rewetted and is characterized by Sphagnum and white beak-rush with patches of open water. The second site represents a disturbed ecosystem, which underwent natural regeneration and is dominated by scrub pine, Sphagnum, and low shrubs. We found that the actively restored site had higher net radiation compared to the second site due to more surface water ponding and however, the higher aerodynamic conductance at the passively restored site contributed to enhanced daytime turbulent fluxes, and hence, both sites had similar aerodynamic temperatures during the daytime. The actively restored site experienced warmer nighttime and seasonal aerodynamic temperature as much of the excess radiation during the day was stored in the water column and released at night. To achieve restoration goals, higher water tables are now maintained throughout large sections of the bog. The study implies that water table manipulation has the potential to minimize greenhouse gas emissions from the bog, thereby allowing the biophysical impacts of peatland restoration to enhance the biogeochemical benefits. Therefore, it is important to consider both biophysical and biogeochemical changes in peatland restoration management.},

	abstract = {Wetland CH4 emissions are among the most uncertain components of the global CH4 budget. The complex nature of wetland CH4 processes makes it challenging to identify causal relationships for improving our understanding and predictability of CH4 emissions. In this study, we used the flux measurements of CH4 from eddy covariance towers (30 sites from 4 wetlands types: bog, fen, marsh, and wet tundra) to construct a causality-constrained machine learning (ML) framework to explain the regulative factors and to capture CH4 emissions at sub-seasonal scale. We found that soil temperature is the dominant factor for CH4 emissions in all studied wetland types. Ecosystem respiration (CO2) and gross primary productivity exert controls at bog, fen, and marsh sites with lagged responses of days to weeks. Integrating these asynchronous environmental and biological causal relationships in predictive models significantly improved model performance. More importantly, modeled CH4 emissions differed by up to a factor of 4 under a +1$\,^{\circ}$C warming scenario when causality constraints were considered. These results highlight the significant role of causality in modeling wetland CH4 emissions especially under future warming conditions, while traditional data-driven ML models may reproduce observations for the wrong reasons. Our proposed causality-guided model could benefit predictive modeling, large-scale upscaling, data gap-filling, and surrogate modeling of wetland CH4 emissions within earth system land models.},

@article{ouyang_paddy_2023,
	abstract = {Although rice cultivation is one of the most important agricultural sources of methane (CH4) and contributes ∼8% of total global anthropogenic emissions, large discrepancies remain among estimates of global CH4 emissions from rice cultivation (ranging from 18 to 115 Tg CH4 yr−1) due to a lack of observational constraints. The spatial distribution of paddy-rice emissions has been assessed at regional-to-global scales by bottom-up inventories and land surface models over coarse spatial resolution (e.g., > 0.5$\,^{\circ}$) or spatial units (e.g., agro-ecological zones). However, high-resolution CH4 flux estimates capable of capturing the effects of local climate and management practices on emissions, as well as replicating in situ data, remain challenging to produce because of the scarcity of high-resolution maps of paddy-rice and insufficient understanding of CH4 predictors. Here, we combine paddy-rice methane-flux data from 23 global eddy covariance sites and MODIS remote sensing data with machine learning to 1) evaluate data-driven model performance and variable importance for predicting rice CH4 fluxes; and 2) produce gridded up-scaling estimates of rice CH4 emissions at 5000-m resolution across Monsoon Asia, where ∼87% of global rice area is cultivated and ∼ 90% of global rice production occurs. Our random-forest model achieved Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency values of 0.59 and 0.69 for 8-day CH4 fluxes and site mean CH4 fluxes respectively, with land surface temperature, biomass and water-availability-related indices as the most important predictors. We estimate the average annual (winter fallow season excluded) paddy rice CH4 emissions throughout Monsoon Asia to be 20.6 $\pm$ 1.1 Tg yr−1 for 2001--2015, which is at the lower range of previous inventory-based estimates (20--32 CH4 Tg yr−1). Our estimates also suggest that CH4 emissions from paddy rice in this region have been declining from 2007 through 2015 following declines in both paddy-rice growing area and emission rates per unit area, suggesting that CH4 emissions from paddy rice in Monsoon Asia have likely not contributed to the renewed growth of atmospheric CH4 in recent years.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric methane (CH4) concentrations have shown a puzzling resumption in growth since 2007 following a period of stabilization from 2000 to 2006. Multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain the temporal variations in CH4 growth, and attribute the rise of atmospheric CH4 either to increases in emissions from fossil fuel activities, agriculture and natural wetlands, or to a decrease in the atmospheric chemical sink. Here, we use a comprehensive ensemble of CH4 source estimates and isotopic δ13C-CH4 source signature data to show that the resumption of CH4 growth is most likely due to increased anthropogenic emissions. Our emission scenarios that have the fewest biases with respect to isotopic composition suggest that the agriculture, landfill and waste sectors were responsible for 53 ± 13\\% of the renewed growth over the period 2007–2017 compared to 2000–2006; industrial fossil fuel sources explained an additional 34 ± 24\\%, and wetland sources contributed the least at 13 ± 9\\%. The hypothesis that a large increase in emissions from natural wetlands drove the decrease in atmospheric δ13C-CH4 values cannot be reconciled with current process-based wetland CH4 models. This finding suggests the need for increased wetland measurements to better understand the contemporary and future role of wetlands in the rise of atmospheric methane and climate feedback. Our findings highlight the predominant role of anthropogenic activities in driving the growth of atmospheric CH4 concentrations.},

  abstract = {While growth history of vegetation within upland systems is well studied, plant phenology within coastal tidal systems is less understood. Landscape-scale, satellite-derived indicators of plant greenness may not adequately represent seasonality of vegetation biomass and productivity within tidal wetlands due to limitations of cloud cover, satellite temporal frequency, and attenuation of plant signals by tidal flooding. However, understanding plant phenology is necessary to gain insight into aboveground biomass, photosynthetic activity, and carbon sequestration. In this study, we use a modeling approach to estimate plant greenness throughout a year in tidal wetlands located within the San Francisco Bay Area, USA. We used variables such as EVI history, temperature, and elevation to predict plant greenness on a 14-day timestep. We found this approach accurately estimated plant greenness, with larger error observed within more dynamic restored wetlands, particularly at early post-restoration stages. We also found modeled EVI can be used as an input variable into greenhouse gas models, allowing for an estimate of carbon sequestration and gross primary production. Our strategy can be further developed in future research by assessing restoration and management effects on wetland phenological dynamics and through incorporating the entire Sentinel-2 time series once it becomes available within Google Earth Engine.},

  abstract = {Time series of wetland methane fluxes measured by eddy covariance require gap-filling to estimate daily, seasonal, and annual emissions. Gap-filling methane fluxes is challenging because of high variability and complex responses to multiple drivers. To date, there is no widely established gap-filling standard for wetland methane fluxes, with regards both to the best model algorithms and predictors. This study synthesizes results of different gap-filling methods systematically applied at 17 wetland sites spanning boreal to tropical regions and including all major wetland classes and two rice paddies. Procedures are proposed for: 1) creating realistic artificial gap scenarios, 2) training and evaluating gap-filling models without overstating performance, and 3) predicting half-hourly methane fluxes and annual emissions with realistic uncertainty estimates. Performance is compared between a conventional method (marginal distribution sampling) and four machine learning algorithms. The conventional method achieved similar median performance as the machine learning models but was worse than the best machine learning models and relatively insensitive to predictor choices. Of the machine learning models, decision tree algorithms performed the best in cross-validation experiments, even with a baseline predictor set, and artificial neural networks showed comparable performance when using all predictors. Soil temperature was frequently the most important predictor whilst water table depth was important at sites with substantial water table fluctuations, highlighting the value of data on wetland soil conditions. Raw gap-filling uncertainties from the machine learning models were underestimated and we propose a method to calibrate uncertainties to observations. The python code for model development, evaluation, and uncertainty estimation is publicly available. This study outlines a modular and robust machine learning workflow and makes recommendations for, and evaluates an improved baseline of, methane gap-filling models that can be implemented in multi-site syntheses or standardized products from regional and global flux networks (e.g., FLUXNET).}

  abstract = {Abstract While wetlands are the largest natural source of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere, they represent a large source of uncertainty in the global CH4 budget due to the complex biogeochemical controls on CH4 dynamics. Here we present, to our knowledge, the first multi-site synthesis of how predictors of CH4 fluxes (FCH4) in freshwater wetlands vary across wetland types at diel, multiday (synoptic), and seasonal time scales. We used several statistical approaches (correlation analysis, generalized additive modeling, mutual information, and random forests) in a wavelet-based multi-resolution framework to assess the importance of environmental predictors, nonlinearities and lags on FCH4 across 23 eddy covariance sites. Seasonally, soil and air temperature were dominant predictors of FCH4 at sites with smaller seasonal variation in water table depth (WTD). In contrast, WTD was the dominant predictor for wetlands with smaller variations in temperature (e.g., seasonal tropical/subtropical wetlands). Changes in seasonal FCH4 lagged fluctuations in WTD by ~17 ± 11 days, and lagged air and soil temperature by median values of 8 ± 16 and 5 ± 15 days, respectively. Temperature and WTD were also dominant predictors at the multiday scale. Atmospheric pressure (PA) was another important multiday scale predictor for peat-dominated sites, with drops in PA coinciding with synchronous releases of CH4. At the diel scale, synchronous relationships with latent heat flux and vapor pressure deficit suggest that physical processes controlling evaporation and boundary layer mixing exert similar controls on CH4 volatilization, and suggest the influence of pressurized ventilation in aerenchymatous vegetation. In addition, 1- to 4-h lagged relationships with ecosystem photosynthesis indicate recent carbon substrates, such as root exudates, may also control FCH4. By addressing issues of scale, asynchrony, and nonlinearity, this work improves understanding of the predictors and timing of wetland FCH4 that can inform future studies and models, and help constrain wetland CH4 emissions.},

Currently, {\$}{\$}{\{}F{\}}{\_}{\{}{\{}{\{}CH{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}4{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}projections rely on prescribed static temperature sensitivity that varies among biogeochemical models.

Mechanistic advancements in biogeochemical model parameterization and detailed measurements in factors modulating CH4 production are thus needed to improve global CH4 budget assessments.},

  abstract = {Seasonal phenological dynamics of vegetation hold important clues on ecosystem performance towards management goals, such as carbon uptake, and thus should be considered in projections of their targeted services. However, in wetlands spatio-temporal heterogeneity due to mixing of open water, soil, green and dead vegetation makes it difficult to generalize ecosystem functioning across different regions. Remote sensing observations can provide spatially-explicit, cost-effective phenology indicators; however, little is known about their capacity to indicate the links between wetland ecosystem structure and function. Here we assessed this potential by comparing one-year Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from satellite products at high (5m; RapidEye) and low (30m; Landsat) spatial resolutions with eddy covariance time series of net carbon exchange, field digital camera (phenocam) greenness and water temperature among three floristically similar restored wetlands in California, USA. Phenological timing differed by wetland site: depending on satellite, the range in site-median start of greening was up to 28 days, end of greening – up to 73 days, start of senescence – up to 79 days, and end of senescence – up to 10 days. Key transition dates from satellite inputs agreed with seasonal changes in net carbon exchange, phenocam greenness and water temperatures, suggesting that phenological contrasts could result in part from site differences in vegetation configuration and litter affecting the exposure of canopy, soil and water to sunlight and thus sub-canopy microclimate and ecosystem functioning. Yet, the agreement between satellite inputs was non-systematic, with the greatest disparities at the more heterogeneous, less vegetated site. Phenological model fitting uncertainty increased with greater spatial resolution, highlighting the tradeoff between the accuracy of representing vegetation and the complexity of local seasonal variation. These findings highlight the sensitivity of satellite-derived phenology to structural and functional heterogeneity of ecosystems and call for more rigorous spatially-explicit analyses to inform assessments of restoration and management outcomes.}

Historically, ∼100 scientists attend; this meeting had over 400 registrants and participants. Participants expressed that this was among the best virtual meetings that they had ever attended, and 100\% of post-meeting survey respondents stated that they would attend again. Feedback revealed the meeting fostered a strong sense of connection to the AmeriFlux community, especially among early career and international scientists. How did a feeling of strong connection to the community arise from the seemingly cold and isolated structures of virtual meetings? The meeting emphasized Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), which resulted in an unexpected enhancement of science communication and community connections. Additionally, the meeting experimented with an online virtual gaming-like world (Gather.town), where users controlled video/audio-enabled avatars in a conference center and poster hall environment to create spontaneous conversations and discussions. In lieu of a social-bonding field trip, participants showed videos of their field sites accompanied by informal banter, which were watched in group settings in Gather. Social mixers were structured over Zoom breakout rooms that were limited in size to promote participation with accessible games. Science talks were selected based on appeal to a demographically diverse organizing committee, which enhanced appeal to a broad meeting audience. Finally, breakout reports were given not in the format of bullet point slides, but instead as creatively improvized fairytales, which dramatically enhanced engagement. Here, we describe some of the process that went into the AmeriFlux 2020 meeting. Keeping with the theme of experimenting and fairytales, we present this narrative in the form of a fairytale; and, without further ado…},

This study addresses one of the major challenges facing model-data integration: To what spatial extent do flux measurements taken at individual eddy-covariance sites reflect model- or satellite-based grid cells? We evaluate flux footprints—the temporally dynamic source areas that contribute to measured fluxes—and the representativeness of these footprints for target areas (e.g., within 250–3000 m radii around flux towers) that are often used in flux-data synthesis and modeling studies. We examine the land-cover composition and vegetation characteristics, represented here by the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), in the flux footprints and target areas across 214 AmeriFlux sites, and evaluate potential biases as a consequence of the footprint-to-target-area mismatch. Monthly 80% footprint climatologies vary across sites and through time ranging four orders of magnitude from 103 to 107 m2 due to the measurement heights, underlying vegetation- and ground-surface characteristics, wind directions, and turbulent state of the atmosphere. Few eddy-covariance sites are located in a truly homogeneous landscape. Thus, the common model-data integration approaches that use a fixed-extent target area across sites introduce biases on the order of 4%–20% for EVI and 6%–20% for the dominant land cover percentage. These biases are site-specific functions of measurement heights, target area extents, and land-surface characteristics. We advocate that flux datasets need to be used with footprint awareness, especially in research and applications that benchmark against models and data products with explicit spatial information. We propose a simple representativeness index based on our evaluations that can be used as a guide to identify site-periods suitable for specific applications and to provide general guidance for data use.}

  abstract = {Abstract Coastal wetlands are among the most productive habitats on Earth and sequester globally significant amounts of atmospheric carbon (C). Extreme rates of soil C accumulation are widely assumed to reflect efficient C storage. Yet the fraction of wetland C lost via hydrologic export has not been directly quantified, since comprehensive budgets including direct estimates of lateral C loss are lacking. We present a complete net ecosystem C budget (NECB), demonstrating that lateral losses of C are a major component of the NECB for the largest stable brackish tidal marsh on the U.S. Pacific coast. Mean annual net ecosystem exchange of CO2 with the atmosphere (NEE = −185 g C m2 year−1, negative NEE denoting ecosystem uptake) was compared to long-term soil C burial (87–110 g C m2 year−1), suggesting only 47–59\% of fixed atmospheric C accumulates in soils. Consistently, direct monitoring in 2017–2018 showed NEE of −255 g C m−2 year−1, and hydrologic export of 105 g C m−2 year−1 (59\% of NEE remaining on site). Despite their high C sequestration capacity, lateral losses from coastal wetlands are typically a larger fraction of the NECB when compared to other terrestrial ecosystems. Loss of inorganic C (the least measured NECB term) was 91\% of hydrologic export and may be the most important term limiting C sequestration. The high productivity of coastal wetlands thus serves a dual function of C burial and estuarine export, and the multiple fates of fixed C must be considered when evaluating wetland capacity for C sequestration.},
