Under normal operating conditions, maintenance trips should occur every 4-6 weeks for each site.  Further trips can be scheduled as needed.  Ensure you are review the key information before commencing field work.  You can checklists below to help prepare for field visits and ensure you are following standard procedures while in the field.\n\n# Key Information\n\n## Planning a Trip\n\nMake a clear list of tasks & goals.  If you are going to one of the one of the flux stations you can\ncheck the field logs.  See what was done on the last visit and check for notes to see if there is anything that needs to be done.\n\n* [BB1&2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1phokxNzc-gJkWIO1zGLUFsSeRgjsq0HE8QAfLlrlNyI/edit#gid=0)\n* [DSM](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1USa7IDpj0D79C8OfFDEoDFKIwjKt0LdVh5fMt04BgpI/edit#gid=0)\n* [RBM](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/114pSwgLBPEeqIezTTIJ4a4Z3kaJhgRvSJZAls8mEOrI?authuser=thruhikerflash%40gmail.com&usp=drive_fs)\n* Use the checklists below to make sure you have all the supplies you need and complete all crucial tasks\n\n## Scheduling & Communication\n\nLet the lab know when you will be going into the field and make sure you have at least one person joining you.\n\n* You can use the fieldwork slack channel to discuss scheduling\n* Book the Micromet Truck using the [google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=3emm9ku32c1gddkcv6ok3s498g%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FVancouver)\n  * Contact Rick for calendar access or to request alternative vehicle options.\n* If you are going into Burns Bog:\n  * Both participants must be permit holders\n  * You must also call Metro Vancouver to check in and check out: **604-520-6442**\n\n## Safety\n\nEnsure that you are familiar with the lab's [Safety Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10oR-eGiVsKmVsdubLDZIrw4zpO6-J2H0/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101091249538878226246&rtpof=true&sd=true) \n\n* **In Summer**: Be cautions of fire safety:\n  * Don't park on gras, bring water sprayer spray and fire extinguisher.\n* **In Winter**: Be mindful of the weather forecasts:\n  * Dress appropriately, bring extra socks, a head lamp, gloves, etc.\n  * Check the tides when going to [RBM](https://www.tide-forecast.com/locations/Steveston-British-Columbia/tides/latest) or [DSM](https://www.tide-forecast.com/locations/White-Rock-British-Columbia/tides/latest)\n\n# Checklists\n\nUse these checklists to help plan and conduct your site visits.\n\n### Pre-Departure\n\n@tbl-packing is best completed the afternoon/evening before a site visit.  Although you many not be able to pack the truck until the morning depending on scheduling, you can still gather supplies.  \n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-packing .cell tbl-cap='Packing List for EC Site Visits' tbl-colwidths='[5,35,60]'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n| id|Item                              |Notes                                                                               |\n|--:|:---------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|  0|Vehicle and Site Keys             |                                                                                    |\n|  1|Field Laptop                      |Charge overnight & bring all necesary calbes plus DC>AC power converter             |\n|  2|USB Sticks                        |One per site - ensure its empty and formattedS                                      |\n|  3|Wildlife Camera SD card           |+ 8 AA batteries per camera as needed                                               |\n|  4|Cleaning Supplies                 |Wipes + washer fluid as needed                                                      |\n|  5|Desiccant                         |4-5 bags / site                                                                     |\n|  6|Water Table Probe                 |Yellow manual probe from lab                                                        |\n|  7|First Aid Kit                     |Red first aid kit kept in ponderosa lab                                             |\n|  8|Water & Snacks                    |                                                                                    |\n|  9|Waders/Boots                      |Waders necessary at BB sites except in summer - Boots are usually okay at DSM & RBM |\n| 10|Spare socks                       |as needed during winter                                                             |\n| 11|Torch or deicing fluids for locks |as needed during winter                                                             |\n| 12|**Site Specific**                 |                                                                                    |\n| 13|*DSM & RMB*                       |                                                                                    |\n| 14|Tool kit                          |                                                                                    |\n| 15|7700 calibration shroud           |                                                                                    |\n| 16|*BB Sites*                        |                                                                                    |\n| 17|Fire exthingusher & water spray   |only needed during fire season                                                      |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### On Site\n\nTo connect to the EC system on site with the laptop, use ethernet port on com box or Wifi if the site has a network connection.\n  * You can also connect via mobile/hotspot using Vinimet if you encounter connectivity issues.\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-on-site .cell tbl-cap='Tasks on EC Site Visits' tbl-colwidths='[5,35,60]'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n| id|Task                         |Notes                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|--:|:----------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|  0|Clean IRGAs as Needed        |See the [Cleaning Page](Cleaning.qmd) for details                                                                                                                                         |\n|  1|Calibrate IRGAs              |See the [Calibration Page](Calibration.qmd) for details                                                                                                                                   |\n|  2|Swap USB in 7550             |Press eject and wait for light to turn off before removal.
