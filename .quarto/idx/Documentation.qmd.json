I have been living and working on unceded Coast Salish Territory since 2015.  My research focuses on using micrometeorology, remote sensing, spatial analysis, and machine learning to understand ecosystem-scale energy, water, and carbon fluxes. I am particularly interested in understanding climate feedback mechanisms and studying how wetland restoration/preservation can be used to help fight climate change."}}},"theme":"cosmo","title":"Documentation"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
