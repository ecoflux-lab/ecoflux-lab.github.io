Thank you for your interest in joining our lab! I am always happy to hear from students and postdocs interested in our ongoing research activities.

Please contact me by email (*sara.knox@ubc.ca*) for more details. The deadline for <a href="https://geog.ubc.ca/graduate/admissions/">applications in geography</a> is mid-December for MSc students and early January for PhD students, however, I encourage you to contact me well before this deadline. Also, please keep in mind the deadlines for external funding opportunities through <a href="https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/pg-cs/index_eng.asp">NSERC</a>. While graduate student support at UBC is available through teaching assistantships and UBC fellowships, I strongly encourage prospective students to apply for external funding.
