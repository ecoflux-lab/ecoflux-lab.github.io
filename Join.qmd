Thank you for your interest in joining our lab! I am always happy to hear from students and postdocs interested in our ongoing research activities.

Please contact me by email (*sara.knox@mcgill.ca*) for more details. The deadline for <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/geography/graduate">applications in geography</a> is January 15, however, I encourage you to contact me well before this deadline. Also, please keep in mind the deadlines for external funding opportunities through <a href="https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/pg-cs/index_eng.asp">NSERC</a>. While graduate student support at McGill is available through teaching assistantships and McGill fellowships, I strongly encourage prospective students to apply for external funding.
