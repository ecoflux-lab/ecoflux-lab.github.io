        "We use git/github to manage our codebase.  Version control is an essential to successfully managing  of any project with multiple contributors!  There can be a steep learning curve when you are first getting started with Git, but the time and hassle you will save your future self by learning will be enormous!\n",

        "\n",
        "Git and Github are both incredibly powerful and useful tools.  They can be used together to work towards a common end, but there are some important distinctions to highlight:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Git** is an open source version control system.  It lets you manage and track your code in \"repositories\", keeping a history of changes each time you make a \"commit\".  You can run git locally on your personal computer and we also run it on our lab's servers.  If you want to install git, you can get started using [these docs](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).\n",
        "\n",
        "**GitHub** is a cloud-based service that hosts Git repositories.  GitHub facilitates calibration between users and within organizations.  [UBC Micromet](https://github.com/ubc-micromet/) is a git \"organization\" that we use to host our operational codebase along with some important documentation.  Github also provides a venue for hosting open source projects so that they can be viewed and accessed by the general public and provides free non-commercial web hosting services which can be used to make documentation pages (like this one!) and [personal websites](https://june-skeeter.github.io/).  Github is not the only option for hosting git repositories; GitLab, Bitbucket, SourceForge, and many other platforms provide similar services.\n",

        "## How Do We Use Git?\n",
        "\n",
        "Our organization's codebase is grouped into repositories, some are operation code that we are actively managing, while others are archived projects that are no longer in use, but still publicly visible.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is a repository?\n",
        "\n",
        "A repository (or repo) is just a collection of code, files, data, etc. that are being tracked by Git.  Generally, all components of a repo should work towards a common end, whether that is an expansive goal such as managing all code used in our [processing pipeline](https://github.com/ubc-micromet/Biomet.net), maintaining the versions of code running on our [data loggers](https://github.com/ubc-micromet/DataLogger_Programs), or the backend of [our organizations website](https://github.com/ubc-micromet/ubc-micromet.github.io)\n",

        "\n",
        "**Branching**: is a way to create a separate workspace to work on updates, test features, and break things (safely) without affecting the \"main\" branch.  We'll rely on branches and \"branch protection\" rules to keep the main (working) branches of repositories safe.  More info can be found [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches)\n",
        "\n",
        "* You can use \"git branch\" to list all existing branches\n",
        "* You can use \"git checkout\" to switch between branches\n",
        "\t* You can also use \"git checkout\" to create an new branch\n",

        "\n",
        "**Conflict Resolution**: This is a tricky task and usually requires a case by case approach to sort things out.  We'll undoubtedly need to do some conflict resolution down the line but lets not worry aoubt it for now.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Github Pages**: Github can be used to render static sites (like this one).  Its a super useful skill/resource.  We'll cover it down the line."
