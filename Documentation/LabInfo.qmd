## Leaving the lab checklist

We're sad to see you go, but we're excited for your next adventure! However, before you leave, make sure to:

1) Upload your code to github (or share it with Sara directly). Make sure to follow the guidelines for reproducible data flow so that we can run all your code after you leave! 

2) Make sure to share all relevant data with Sara. Ideally this would be in the data folder in each of your project/chapter folders.

3) Return all keys, equipment, field gear that belong to be lab/university.
