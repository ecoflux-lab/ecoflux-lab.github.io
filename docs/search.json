Over 95% of the land in BC, and many lands elsewhere in the world were never ceded by treaty. Without treaties, these lands remain the sovereign territory of the First Nations that call them home. Yet at the same time, the lands have been claimed by Canada and these First Nations living on these lands lack a framework to express their sovereignty. This by no means absolves the Canadian government of their crimes where lands were “ceded” by treaty. Treaties were more frequently reached by coercion than negotiation. The RCMP was created specifically to force indigenous people off their lands by any means necessary."

I have been living as an uninvited guest on unceded Coast Salish Territory since 2015 and (will soon receive) a PhD in Geography from the University of British Columbia in 2022. My research focuses on using micrometeorology, remote sensing, spatial analysis, and machine learning to understand ecosystem-scale carbon fluxes. I am particularly interested in climate feedback mechanisms which either exacerbate or can help mitigate climate change.\n\nTzu-Yi Lu, Ph.D Student\n\n I received my MS in Geography from National Taiwan University in 2017. I am interested in understanding the response of the wetland ecosystem to climate change, especially in quantifying the net exchange of carbon. My previous research investigated the relationship between environmental controls and CO2 flux in low-latitude wetland ecosystems, applying an Artificial Neural Network technique to simulate the variance of carbon exchange by meteorological variables.\n\nKatrina Poppe, Ph.D Student\n\nI earned an MS in Environmental Science from Western Washington University in 2016 and continued at WWU as a Research Associate for several years. My previous research has focused primarily on blue carbon, studying soil carbon sequestration rates in Pacific Northwest estuaries and in United Arab Emirates mangroves, in addition to monitoring and modeling vegetation and sediment dynamics in relation to estuary restoration and sea level rise. I am currently interested in studying greenhouse gas fluxes in Pacific Northwest tidal wetlands – particularly how they respond to ecosystem restoration and climate change – to ultimately better understand the value of tidal wetland management actions as natural climate solutions. \nSarah Russell, Ph.D Student\n\n\nI received a BS in Biological Sciences from Wellesley College in 2017, then worked as an ecosystem ecology field technician and research assistant before moving to Vancouver. I am interested in land-atmosphere carbon dynamics and am particularly interested in quantifying the terrestrial carbon sink. My research at UBC involves modeling greenhouse gas fluxes from restored tidal wetlands in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.\n \nDarian Ng, M.Sc. Student\n\nI received a BSc in Atmospheric Science from the University of British Columbia in 2021. I have spent research terms at UBC studying effects of climate change on intertidal ecology, cloud microphysics and precipitation modelling, and methane emission hotspots in wetlands. I’m interested in investigating environmental drivers of land-atmosphere greenhouse gas exchange and how they might respond to changing climate conditions. During my MSc, I plan to further examine the controls of wetland methane emissions and better understand how we can effectively manage wetlands as natural climate solutions.\n\nHehan (Zoe) Zhang, M.Sc. Student\n\nI am currently an undergraduate student majoring in Environmental Science and minoring in Economics at the University of British Columbia. My thesis is studying the effects of postfire recovery on greenhouse gas fluxes in a peatland using chamber measurements. I am particularly interested in investigating land-atmosphere exchanges of greenhouse gas fluxes in disturbed wetland ecosystems and assessing the ecological response of the wetlands after different management practices. I am motivated to obtain more training on climate science topics as a graduate student and explore the effective management practices on wetland restoration.\n\nAdin Litman, B.Sc. Student\n\n\nI am currently a 4th year undergraduate student majoring in Atmospheric Science at UBC. I am working on a direct studies under the supervision of Dr. Knox and Zoe Zhang that researches the impact of heatwaves on greenhouse gas exchange at Burns Bog. I have always been passionate about weather patterns and the environment, and hope to pursue a career in meteorology. In my free time, I enjoy skiing and spending time at the beach.\n \nKelsey McGuire, B.Sc. Student\n\n I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in Geographical Sciences, with concentrations in climatology and Geographic Information Systems. Within the lab, I will mainly be supporting Zoe Zhang with her research on how wildfires impact GHG fluxes at Burns Bog. I hope in later years to conduct more research on land-atmosphere exchanges, specifically around the carbon cycle, and find ways to incorporate different GIS technologies to help in visualizing it."

    "text": "The integrated GHG Research and Observations in Wetlands (iGROW) Research Program\nAmong the numerous ecosystem services provided by wetlands climate regulation is identified as one of their most important benefits to society. Wetland ecosystems play an important role in the global carbon cycle; they provide the ideal environment for long-term storage of atmospheric carbon dioxide, yet they are also the largest single source of methane. Climate change has the potential to increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from wetlands, however, the consequences of rising temperatures on wetland GHG exchange remains uncertain. Furthermore, preventing further wetland loss and restoring wetland ecosystems has been identified by researchers and governments as important in limiting future emissions to help meet climate goals. The integrated GHG Research and Observations in Wetlands (iGROW) research program’, takes an interdisciplinary approach to provide a better understanding of how wetland responses to climate variability and restoration can feedback to slow or accelerate future climate change. iGROW combines state-of-the-art field-based measurements, remote sensing, and modelling to provide new insights into the controls of wetland GHG fluxes across a range of spatial and temporal scales and quantify the potential climate benefits of wetland restoration and conservation. This research is key to better predicting current and future contributions of wetlands to climate change, which is highly relevant for policies aiming to limit the level of global temperature rise. Current iGROW research projects include:\n\nCarbon Fluxes in Restored Wetlands\n\nIn collaboration with several other research groups at UBC, my lab’s research is focused on measuring GHG, water, and energy fluxes over Burns Bog, a restored peatland in Metro Vancouver. This site is a raised domed peat bog that is undergoing re-wetting as a restoration management strategy following peat harvesting and associated drainage. While restoration can help recover important ecosystems services provided by wetlands, it can also affect the exchange of greenhouse gases, water and energy between the surface and the atmosphere.\n\nBy conducting year-round eddy covariance measurements, we are assessing the biogeochemical and biophysical impacts of peatland restoration, and the impacts of forest fire smoke on carbon cycling and energy fluxes in restored peatlands. This research is also being done in collaboration with researchers and staff at Metro Vancouver who are interested in quantifying the climate mitigation potential of wetland restoration and conservation. \nCollaborators:  UBC Ecohydrology Research Group  UBC Biometeorology and Soil Physics Group  Dan Moore’s Research Group, UBC Geography \nNews on Burns Bog:  April 20, 2023 - Up in smoke: Human activities are fuelling wildfires that burn essential carbon-sequestering peatlands  June 16, 2021 - David Suzuki: For climate’s sake, save the peat!  June 29, 2020 - Carbon Neutral Achievement Sets Stage for Bold Climate Action \n\n\nBlue Carbon Research\n\nBlue carbon is the carbon sequestered and stored in coastal ecosystems including tidal marshes, mangroves, and seagrasses. Coastal ecosystems are among the strongest carbon sinks in the biosphere. This coupled with their potential for low methane emissions, has generated widespread interest in these ecosystems for climate change mitigation and adaptation. However, measuring and modelling carbon exchanges in tidal wetlands presents unique challenges due to highly dynamic atmospheric and hydrological fluxes, as well as sensitivities to both terrestrial and marine influences. Through iGROW, my research group recently installed two eddy covariance flux towers (CA-DSM and CA-RBM) in tidal wetlands along the Pacific Coast of Canada to quantify and model the net carbon and GHG balance of these marshes, which represent an important data gap in ecosystem-scale measurements of GHG exchange from tidal marshes. In partnership West Coast Environmental Law, we are also working to translate this blue carbon science into policy-relevant information for municipalities and provincial governments. \n\nOur research group is also involved in the NSF funded Coastal Carbon Research Coordination Network. Specifically, we are involved in the Methane Working Group, which aims to compile all methane flux data from coastal habitats (excluding mangroves) in the CONUS to parameterize and validate a set of nested process-based methane models. \nAdditionally, we are part of a U.S. Department of Energy grant “High-frequency Data Integration for Landscape Model Calibration of Carbon Fluxes Across Diverse Tidal Marshes” focused on leveraging eddy covariance observations to improve landscape-scale models of carbon fluxes across tidal marshes. This grant brings together university and government researchers from across the U.S. \nI am also a co-investigator on a collaborative research effort to model the current and future mitigation capacity of Canada’s blue carbon ecosystems, which was recently funded by an NSERC Alliance grant. The project is led by Julia Baum (University of Victoria), and includes four co-principal investigators and seventeen collaborators from across the country which are contributing to this national natural ocean climate solutions research effort. The project brings together a consortium of four universities, three government agencies, and four eNGOs. \nPrimary Collaborators:  Oikawa Lab, California State University, East Bay  The U.S. Geological Survey  The Baum Lab, University of Victoria  O’Connor Lab, The University of British Columbia \n\n\nCarbon Cycling in the Prairie Pothole Region of Canada\n\nWith growing interest in wetland management and restoration as a Natural Climate Solution, improved estimates of wetland carbon sequestration and GHG fluxes across Canadian wetland types are strongly needed. In partnership with Ducks Unlimited Canada, we focus on wetlands in the Prairie Pothole Region of western Canada since these ecosystems are understudied relative to other wetland types in Canada, yet they play important roles in carbon cycling and climate regulation. Specifically, this study leverages existing funding and infrastructure to investigate carbon and GHG dynamics across two wetland sites, with the aims of measuring and modeling GHG fluxes in prairie wetlands in Manitoba.\nPrimary Collaborators:  Ducks Unlimited Canada - Pascal Badiou \nPrairie Wetlands in the News:  May 19, 2022 - Project intended to demonstrate wetlands’ greenhouse gas impact  April 20, 2022 - DUC analyzing wetlands on farms and ranches for carbon capture  April, 2022 - DUC Carbon Tower Project"

They are also the largest, and most uncertain, natural source of CH4 to the atmosphere. Direct observations of local CH4 emissions with high measurement frequency are important for constraining CH4 budgets, for understanding the responses of CH4 fluxes to environmental factors and climate, and for creating validation datasets for the land-surface models used to infer global CH4 budgets. However, unlike well-coordinated efforts for synthesizing CO2 flux-tower observations (e.g., FLUXNET), no such network and data synthesis effort existed previously for CH4. \n\nFLUXNET-CH4 is an initiative coordinated through the Global Carbon Project in close partnership with AmeriFlux and EuroFlux, to compile a global database of eddy covariance CH4 flux measurements to answer regional and global questions related to the global CH4 cycle. Through this activity, we coordinated the collection, aggregation, standardization, and post-processing of global CH4 data from the flux tower community. FLUXNET-CH4 Version 1.0 includes data from 81 sites, representing freshwater, coastal, upland, natural, and managed ecosystems. \nAdditionally, through a USGS Powell Center Working Group, we leveraged the FLUXNET-CH4 to provide novel insights into the controls and timing of wetland CH4 emissions for North America and globally, inform and validate biogeochemical models, and upscale wetland CH4 flux measurements globally. \nCollaborators:  Jackson Lab, Stanford University  NASA Goddard  Global Carbon Project  Stanford Machine Learning Group \n\n\nQuantifying carbon benefits of tidal wetland restoration in the Delta: Decision support using a robust, integrated and data-driven model\n\nThis research was funded through the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and focused on advancing remote sensing data in tidally flooded marshes and using the data to improve modeling of greenhouse gases in these systems.

It makes it easier for to share code and work with collaborators.\n\n\nA repository (or repo) is just a collection of code, files, data, etc. that are being tracked by Git.\n\n\n\ninit: Creates an empty repository\ncommit: Tells git to “save” a repository in its current state.\nstatus: Checks to see if there are any “untracked” files in your workspace.\nclone:: Tells git to “copy” a repository from a remote location (i.e. a github URL) to a local directory on you computer\npull:: Tells git to “download” any changes from a remote repository (i.e. a github URL you previously cloned) to your local copy\npush: Tells git to “upload” any changes from a local (your computer) copy of a repository to a remote repository (i.e. a github URL you previously cloned)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNice video tutorial\n\n\nThese guidelines will inform how we approach collaborating on a project.\nAdd Git Branch Name to Terminal Prompt (Linux/Mac)\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes you break something and need to know how to fix it. Pardon the profanity … but Oh Shit, Git is a really helpful resource."
