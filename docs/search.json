We also present some examples of how to quickly check the contents of your new database.\nOn this page:\n\nSample data for tutorial\nCreate database\nVisualize and inspect database\nSample code\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you wish to use our sample raw flux and met data to work through the example, click the following “Sample_Data_For_Tutorial” link, unzip the contents, and keep them handy:\nSample_Data_For_Tutorial\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs previously mentioned, we will follow an example that focuses on flux-related EddyPro and met-related Campbell Scientific output data. If your data has a different format, we recommend first carrying out the steps below using our sample data to see how the process works. Section 5.2 provides some examples of functions to deal with different data formats.\n\n\nFirst, in your newly created Sites directory, within the relevant SITEID directory, create a new Flux folder (figure 4.2A).\n\nFigure 4.2A. Directory tree showing file path to the location where raw flux data for site with SITEID1 should be stored.\nCopy the EddyPro raw output data to this Flux folder. This data will remain untouched so that you always have a local copy of the original data.\nNow, create a Met folder within the same SITEID directory (SITEID1 in this example), and copy the Campbell Scientific TOA5 data for this site to this Met folder.\nIn your &lt;projectPath&gt;/Matlab folder, create a new “main” Matlab file that will act as a “do-it-all” script. You can name this file however you like; we advise making it meaningful and including the word “Main”. The example given here (figure 4.2B) is named DataCleaning_Main.m (you can make your filename less generic) — it will first create the database, and later you can add the code for data cleaning. This script can be copied section by section from the code block at the bottom of this page.\n\nFigure 4.2B. Matlab code to create database from raw EddyPro output and Campbell Scientific logger meteorological data.

There are also some FAQ, and some guidance on special cases and how to handle them.\nNote that this page will continue to be updated as the pipeline is further developed and tested.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore running data cleaning, first make sure you have the most recent version of the Biomet.net library (see section 2.2 for details). The code is updated regularly and you should be updating your local repository at least once per week. If you downloaded the Biomet.net library (rather than cloned it), make sure that you renamed it exactly as Biomet.net since the download includes “main” in the folder name.\nWhen running data cleaning (any stage), pay very close attention to the output on your screen. It tells you when everything runs smoothly, and if something goes wrong, in most cases it will be informative as to why and whereabouts things went wrong.\nAvoid having extra white space in your INI file between [TRACE] and [END]. Each parameter must be defined on a new line, with no wraparound. We recommend using a text editor that has line numbers (such as VS Code) to help you avoid and/or diagnose this issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have multiple files containing data from one site, e.g., daily, monthly, or annual files. How do I create one database from all my files?\n\nSee section 5.2: subsection “Create Database from Multiple Input Files and Updates for Continuous Operational Sites”.\n\nI have multiple flux sites. Once I’ve added one site and created my database with data from that site (and cleaned it, etc.), what are the steps to move on to my next site?\n\ncreate_TAB_ProjectFolders has a third optional input argument, flagAddingSiteOnly. After setting up your project with your first flux site, define your second site ID, then set this argument to TRUE (or ‘1’). Here is an example of code to create a project from scratch and then add a second site:\n\n % Define project path and first site ID\n     projectPath = '/Users/&lt;username&gt;/Projects/test-project/';\n     siteID = 'SITEID1';\n % Create project\n     create_TAB_ProjectFolders(projectPath,siteID);\n % Define second site ID\n     siteID = 'SITEID2';\n % Add site only using same function\n     create_TAB_ProjectFolders(projectPath,siteID,1);\nI replaced my 2-m air temperature (or any other) sensor; how do I tell Matlab to read multiple date ranges, one for each sensor?\n\nUse the inputFileName and inputFileName_dates parameters, with the syntax as in the following example, showing three different sensors with their respective date ranges:\n\nvariableName = 'TA_1_1_1'\ntitle = 'Air temperature at 2m (HMP)'\noriginalVariable = 'Air temperature at 2m (HMP)'\ninputFileName = {'MET_HMP_T_2m_Avg','LI7700_Tair','MET_HMP155_2m'}\ninputFileName_dates = [datenum(2010,1,1) datenum(2020,1,1);datenum(2020,1,1) datenum(2024,1,1);datenum(2024,1,1) datenum(2999,1,1)]\nmeasurementType = 'met'\nunits = '∞C'\ninstrument = 'HMP155A'\n...\nHow do I incorporate data from other sources such as nearby climate stations, e.g., for gap-filling, into my database?\n\nSee section 5.2: subsection “Create Database Using Data from Canadian Meteorological Stations”.\n\nWhen I run third stage cleaning, why does it finish so quickly (less than a minute), and/or why is there is no data output in the Database directory?\n\nCheck the log file that is produced automatically when running the third stage (SITEID1_ThirdStageCleaning.log). It is informative and will usually tell you the issue; it is located here:\n\nScreenshot showing the location of the third stage log file.\nCheck that all R packages are installed and loaded. Refer to the code provided in section 2.5 for this.\nCheck that after you downloaded and unzipped the Biomet.net library, you renamed it from Biomet.net-main to Biomet.net.\n\nMatlab cannot find R/Rscript on my computer, even though it is installed with the correct versions. How do I fix this?\n\nCreate a function called biomet_Rpath_default.m and put it in your project Matlab folder. You can explicitly define the path to the Rscript executable file, like in the example below:\nMac example:\nfunction folderR = biomet_Rpath_default\n  folderR = '/usr/local/bin/Rscript';\nWindows example:\nfunction folderR = biomet_Rpath_default\n  folderR = 'C:\\Program Files\\R\\R-4.4.1\\bin\\Rscript.exe';\nThis can happen if R and/or Matlab are not both in “Program Files” folder, on Windows.\n\nMy raw eddy-covariance data has a frequency of 10 Hz (rather than 20 Hz): how do I tell the pipeline to utilize this information in the diagnostics, used records and file records?\n\nIn your SITEID1_FirstStage.ini file, you can use global variables to overwrite diagnostic settings defined in include files (see section 5.3: subsection Global variables and include files), as follows:\n %--&gt; For specifying minMax number of used records and file records depending on frequency, e.g.: \n % Example: globalVars.Trace.used_records.minMax = [1500*frequency 1800*frequency] %(where frequency is typically 10 or 20 Hz)\n globalVars.Trace.used_records.minMax                    = [15000 18000] \n globalVars.Trace.file_records.minMax                    = [15000 18000]\n\nIs there a fast way to check whether variables loaded into my database actually contain data (or if all data points are NaN)?\n\nYes. Call the following function by giving it siteID, year, and cleaning stage number (1 or 2), and it will return the names of all traces from that stage that contain no other numbers but NaNs:\ncntAllNanFiles = findAllNaNfiles('DSM',2025,1);\nAlternatively, you can just point it to a folder with database files without specifying anything else:\ncntAllNanFiles = findAllNaNfiles('E:\\Pipeline_Projects\\database\\2024\\DSM\\Clean\\SecondStage');\nSample output: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis section outlines some recurring special cases and how to deal with them:\n\nThere is a variable defined in an include INI file that I have no raw input data for.\nIn this case, you can add the following code to the global variables section of your first stage INI file. Remember to change the name of the “dummyVariable” to match the name of the variable you do not have.\n %--&gt;Avoiding errors due to missing input files \n dateRangeNoData = [datenum(1900,1,1) datenum(1900,12,31)]\n globalVars.Trace.dummyVariable.inputFileName_dates = dateRangeNoData\nE.g., if you are running data cleaning for the year 2023, this code essentially tells the pipeline that for this “dummyVariable”, no data exists for 2023 (and only exists for the year 1900), and the program will continue smoothly with no errors.\nI am using an earlier version of Matlab than 2023b, and I’m getting an error when running the create_TAB_ProjectFolders function. How do I fix this?\nDownload this zip file, unzip, and put the contents of the unzipped directory within your own project directory; make sure your directory structure looks like figure 4.1 in section 4.\nThe gitclone Matlab function is used within the create_TAB_ProjectFolders function to transfer (clone) the directory structure and files within. However, gitclone was only added to Matlab 2023b, so you need to download this project directory structure directly.\nIf it is an error related to gitclone, the error will occur on the line that gitclone is called, so you can check this in the error message, e.g., it may look like this:\nError: File: create_TAB_ProjectFolders.m Line: 66 Column: 32\n Incorrect use of '=' operator. To assign a value to a variable, use '='. To compare values for equality, use '=='.\n\nI am working on a Linux operating system and first stage cleaning crashes with an error unable to open the “Met” or “Flux” database folder, e.g.:\n*** Error! File: \".../Database/2024/RBM/met/Clean/TA_1_1_1\" cannot be opened!\nThis is because the measurementType parameter in your first stage INI file has lower case. To fix this, make sure that you are using upper case for the measurementType parameter everywhere it appears in your first stage INI, e.g., measurementType = 'Met' or measurementType = 'Flux'.\nI am starting with a “clean” data set, for example from Ameriflux or ICOS. Is there a quick or generic way to create INI files directly from this data to get it into the pipeline to run third stage/gap-filling?\n\nYes, we have a generic way of doing this, and one specifically designed for data downloaded from Ameriflux (BASE and BIF).\nUsually, these input files have a small number of traces (&lt;100) and they don’t need to use our “include” files.\nOnce the INI files are created, they can be edited to include some additional cleaning or data manipulation.\n\nGeneric solution:\n\nFirst convert the input (usually CSV) files to our database format (see sections 4.2/5.2).\nRun the code below, after editing the inputs to match your site. In particular, make sure you get the siteID and the startYear right.\n\n startYear = 2021;\n siteID = 'mySite'\n GMT_offset = -8;\n\n % Set input parameters:\n structSetup.startYear = startYear;\n structSetup.startMonth = 1;\n structSetup.startDay = 1;\n structSetup.endYear = 2999;\n structSetup.endMonth = 12;\n structSetup.endDay = 31;\n structSetup.Site_name = 'Long name here';\n structSetup.siteID = siteID;\n structSetup.allMeasurementTypes = {'Flux'};\n structSetup.Difference_GMT_to_local_time = -GMT_offset;     % local+Difference_GMT_to_local_time -&gt; GMT time\n structSetup.outputPath = [];                                % keep it in the local directory\n structSetup.isTemplate = false;                             % Set to false if you want to create \n\n % create template:\n createFirstStageIni(structSetup)\n\n % SecondStage template:\n createSecondStageIni(structSetup)\nAmeriflux solution:\n\nEdit site ID(s), data source path (where you put your downloaded Ameriflux data), and project path as necessary.\n\n % Convert Ameriflux BASE+BIF files into TAB database project\n\n % Example creating a new project with two sites:\n allNewSites = {'BR-Npw','CA-BOU'};\n dbID = 'AMF';\n sourcePath = 'E:\\Pipeline_Projects\\Ameriflux_raw';\n projectPath = 'E:\\Pipeline_Projects\\Ameriflux_CH4_v2'\n flagNewSites = false\n result = convertAmeriflux2TAB(allNewSites,dbID,sourcePath,projectPath,flagNewSites);\n% Example: adding a new site to an existing project\n allNewSites = {'CA-DSM'};\n dbID = 'AMF';\n sourcePath = 'E:\\Pipeline_Projects\\Ameriflux_raw';\n projectPath = 'E:\\Pipeline_Projects\\Ameriflux_CH4_v2'\n flagNewSites = true\n result = convertAmeriflux2TAB(allNewSites,dbID,sourcePath,projectPath,flagNewSites);",

There are also some FAQ, and some guidance on special cases and how to handle them.\nNote that this page will continue to be updated as the pipeline is further developed and tested.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore running data cleaning, first make sure you have the most recent version of the Biomet.net library (see section 2.2 for details). The code is updated regularly and you should be updating your local repository at least once per week. If you downloaded the Biomet.net library (rather than cloned it), make sure that you renamed it exactly as Biomet.net since the download includes “main” in the folder name.\nWhen running data cleaning (any stage), pay very close attention to the output on your screen. It tells you when everything runs smoothly, and if something goes wrong, in most cases it will be informative as to why and whereabouts things went wrong.\nAvoid having extra white space in your INI file between [TRACE] and [END]. Each parameter must be defined on a new line, with no wraparound. We recommend using a text editor that has line numbers (such as VS Code) to help you avoid and/or diagnose this issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have multiple files containing data from one site, e.g., daily, monthly, or annual files. How do I create one database from all my files?\n\nSee section 5.2: subsection “Create Database from Multiple Input Files and Updates for Continuous Operational Sites”.\n\nI have multiple flux sites.

    "text": "This section provides the same instructions as the quick-start set up in section 4.1, but in much greater detail.\nOn this page:\n\nSetting up your project directory structure and configure Matlab to work with Biomet.net\nConfigure Matlab for directory structure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach user should have at least one Project directory which encompasses data cleaning/analysis/research for a group of similar flux sites, e.g., FLUXNET-Canada-V2.0. You will need the full file path to this Project directory, and also you will need to create a site IDs(s) for your flux site(s), if they do not already exist. Site IDs are usually acronyms based on the site name.\nImportant notes:\n\nWe enforce using uppercase for site IDs, to avoid problems with running data cleaning on Mac vs. Windows. Examples: the Delta Salt Marsh site ID is DSM; the Turkey Point Agriculture site ID is TPAG.\nSite IDs must also be a valid Matlab variable name: they should start with a letter, can only be alphanumeric, and are allowed to contain underscores but no other special characters (no hyphens!), e.g., PE_TNR.\nYour project directory must be on your local computer: avoid putting it on an external drive or cloud drive (like OneDrive or GDrive) as this will cause problems in the steps that follow. Additionally, avoid putting it in the Biomet.net directory.\nYour &lt;projectPath&gt;, which you will need when following the instructions, is the full filepath to your Project root directory. E.g., if your project is called My_Micromet, the project path would be similar to /Users/&lt;username&gt;/Projects/My_Micromet/.\n\nWe provide functions within the Biomet library to help you set up the project directory structure and configure Matlab:\n\n\n\nIf you have multiple flux sites, choose one site to begin working with. Using the Matlab command line, define your projectPath and siteID as in the following example:\nFor example, if the name of your project is My_Micromet, and your chosen siteID is SITEID1, you would enter the following commands in the Matlab command window:\nMac example:\n projectPath = '/Users/&lt;username&gt;/Projects/My_Micromet/';\n siteID = 'SITEID1';\nPC example:\n projectPath = 'C:\\Projects\\My_Micromet\\';\n siteID = 'SITEID1';\nNext, in Matlab, run the create_TAB_ProjectFolders function (which is in the Biomet.net library that you cloned or downloaded), as follows:\n create_TAB_ProjectFolders(projectPath,siteID)\nBoth input arguments are of type “string”. You can use single '' or double \"\" quotation marks for these purposes in Matlab, although technically, these mean slightly different things; see this link for more info. \n\nInstructions continue below (Configure Matlab for directory structure) following these details on the create_TAB_ProjectFolders function, which takes care of several steps for you, outlined next:\n\nIn your Project root directory (My_Micromet in figure 5.1A), you should now see three directories with the following names: (1) Database, (2) Matlab, (3) Sites. In this directory tree example, there are three project root directories to illustrate the structure in case you have more than one project: My_Micromet (highlighted in green), CH4_V2.0, and FLUXNET-Canada-V2.0; although you may only have one.\n\nFigure 5.1A Directory tree showing contents of My_Micromet project folder after running the create_TAB_ProjectFolders Matlab function; also shown is the structure if there are multiple projects, e.g., My_Micromet, CH4_V2.0, FLUXNET-Canada-V2.0.\n\nIf you do not see these contents, and/or Matlab gives you an error on running create_TAB_ProjectFolders, you should check which version of Matlab you are using. If you are working with an earlier version of Matlab than 2023b, this is likely the cause of the issue. In this case, download this zip file, unzip, and put the contents of “My_Micromet_Folder” within your project directory (underneath My_Micromet); then make sure your directory structure looks like figure 4.1.\nNOTE: The directory information given next is simply descriptions of the contents of these folders and their purpose. The next instructions to follow are below under “Configure Matlab for Directory Structure”.\n\n\n\nWithin the new Database directory that you just made, you will find another new directory called Calculation_Procedures, and within Calculation_Procedures, there should be two subdirectories: AmeriFlux and TraceAnalysis_ini. Eventually your initial database and cleaned data will go here (instructions are in future sections).\n\nIn the Ameriflux folder, the create_TAB_ProjectFolders.m function has cloned a git repository containing necessary files (figure 5.1B, highlighted in blue) that will be needed later if you want to convert your cleaned data into AmeriFlux format.\n\nFigure 5.1B. Directory tree showing contents of AmeriFlux directory after running the create_TAB_ProjectFolders Matlab function.\nWithin TraceAnalysis_ini, you will see a subdirectory named using your SITEID (SITEID1 in this example, figure 5.1C), as follows:\n\nFigure 5.1C. Directory tree showing contents of TraceAnalysis_ini directory after running the create_TAB_ProjectFolders Matlab function.\nNow, if you navigate to that SITEID1 directory, you should see two more folders: Derived_Variables and log (figure 5.1D). Your site-specific INI files will eventually go into this SITEID1 directory.\n\nFigure 5.1D. Directory tree showing contents of SITEID1 directory within TraceAnalysis_ini, after running the create_TAB_ProjectFolders Matlab function.\nWithin the TraceAnalysis_ini folder, you should also find a series of “include” files (that were cloned by the create_TAB_ProjectFolders function; figure 5.1C); these are important, and their purpose is described in detail in section 5.3.\n\n\n\n\n\nRaw, uncleaned data from your site(s) will be stored in the &lt;projectPath&gt;/Sites directory (Figure 5.1E), under the appropriate siteID. The data in this directory should remain untouched since we always want to preserve a copy of the raw data.\n\nFigure 5.1E. Directory tree showing contents of Sites folder after running the create_TAB_ProjectFolders Matlab function.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis directory should now contain three matlab files:\n\n\nget_TAB_project_configuration.m which was created “behind the scenes” in step 2 above;\n\n\nbiomet_database_default.m; and\n\n\nbiomet_sites_default.m.\n\n\n\nThe latter two functions are used in the pipeline behind the scenes and may also be useful to you later when you want to visualize your data.\nOnce you have confirmed all files and folders appear as described above, you can now move on to the next step which configures Matlab for the directory structure you just created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Step 3 in quick-start guide; section 4.1) Run\nset_TAB_project(projectPath)\n\nThis process sets up the Biomet.net toolbox to work with your project.\nIf you wish to, you can add the name of your project, for documentation purposes only, to the new file get_TAB_project_configuration.m which was created when running set_TAB_project(projectPath) in step 3.\n\nOptional final step: open (but do not run) get_TAB_project_configuration.m, located in /&lt;projectPath&gt;/Matlab/ and enter your projectName (user-preferred name, this is just for documentation purposes and not used for processing). The file should look like this:\nfunction structProject = get_TAB_project_configuration  (projectPath)\nprojectName = 'My_Micromet project is the best';\nstructProject.projectName   = projectName;\nstructProject.path          = fullfile(projectPath);\nstructProject.databasePath  = fullfile(structProject.path,'Database');\nstructProject.sitesPath     = fullfile(structProject.path,'Sites');\nstructProject.matlabPath    = fullfile(structProject.path,'Matlab');\n[In case you do not have this script, you can simply copy this code and edit the string assigned to projectName.]\nMatlab is now ready to run data processing and cleaning for that particular project.\n\nAt this point, your Matlab directory should contain the following files:\n\nThe two files not previously discussed, i.e., biomet_database_default.m and biomet_sites_default.m were automatically generated by set_TAB_project.m. If you run either of these on your command line in Matlab, you will see that it returns the full file path to either your Database or your Sites directory, respectively.",

The next instructions to follow are below under “Configure Matlab for Directory Structure”.\n\n\n\nWithin the new Database directory that you just made, you will find another new directory called Calculation_Procedures, and within Calculation_Procedures, there should be two subdirectories: AmeriFlux and TraceAnalysis_ini. Eventually your initial database and cleaned data will go here (instructions are in future sections).\n\nIn the Ameriflux folder, the create_TAB_ProjectFolders.m function has cloned a git repository containing necessary files (figure 5.1B, highlighted in blue) that will be needed later if you want to convert your cleaned data into AmeriFlux format.\n\nFigure 5.1B. Directory tree showing contents of AmeriFlux directory after running the create_TAB_ProjectFolders Matlab function.\nWithin TraceAnalysis_ini, you will see a subdirectory named using your SITEID (SITEID1 in this example, figure 5.1C), as follows:\n\nFigure 5.1C. Directory tree showing contents of TraceAnalysis_ini directory after running the create_TAB_ProjectFolders Matlab function.\nNow, if you navigate to that SITEID1 directory, you should see two more folders: Derived_Variables and log (figure 5.1D). Your site-specific INI files will eventually go into this SITEID1 directory.\n\nFigure 5.1D.

    "text": "This section complements the quick-start set up in section 4.2.\nOn this page:\n\nBest practices\nUseful information on creating your database\nCreate Database From Multiple Input Files and Updates for Continuous Operational Sites\nCreate Database Using Data from Canadian Meteorological Stations\nCreate Database Using Data from U.S. Meteorological Stations\nVisualize and inspect your newly created database\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best-practice approach for each project is to have one “main” script for data processing (e.g., DataCleaning_Main.m). This script should contain all the steps that are needed to go from raw data to the final cleaned and gap-filled Ameriflux data set:\n\nObtaining/downloading the raw data (not covered here, we assume you have your own systems for obtaining datalogger output from your sites);\nCreating the database in the appropriate format (this current subsection);\nApplying the data-cleaning stages (subsections 5.3, 5.4, and 5.5).\n\n\nEach flux site is unique with its own sensors, data loggers, and data archiving formats (such as EddyPro output files, TOA5 Campbell Scientific files, Ameriflux CSV files, to name a few). The purpose of step 2 is to convert from such a site-specific dataset to a generic dataset ready to be processed using the standardised libraries (i.e., Biomet.net). These “generic” binary files can be read by most computer languages, by design, meaning they are suitable for the Biomet library which contains code written in Matlab, R, and Python.\nIf you need help getting started with your “main” computer program, a sample Matlab script is provided in the quick-start guide (section 4.2, under “Sample Code”). With that DataCleaning_Main.m script the entire data processing process is documented and it can be easily replicated. Insert as many informative comments as you can - it will help if the process needs to be reviewed later on or the project is handed over to another person. When working with your own data, especially for the first time using the pipeline, we still recommend following the steps in the tutorial as they also outline where to put your raw data files, and other important tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetermine the data format/source of raw data in your Sites directory.\nUse standard existing function(s) from the Biomet.net library, which you have already cloned/downloaded, to convert your raw data and create the database in Database directory. Examples of functions that can read your data and be used in your “main” script are as follows:\n\ndb_struct2database (create database from Matlab structure; flux or met data);\nfr_read_EddyPro_file (create database from EddyPro output; flux data);\nfr_read_TOA5_file (create database from TOA5 Campbell Scientific ASCII files);\nfr_read_generic_data_file (create database from most file formats).\n\n\n\n\nThe relevant function, when run in matlab, will create subdirectories named by data year (yearIn), then by SITEID (i.e., SITEIDs are grouped by year), as follows:\n\nFigure 5.2A. Directory tree showing structure of Database folder for multiple years and multiple sites under one project.\nThe SITEID subdirectories will be populated with data (e.g., Flux and Met if these data types exist) for the appropriate year, stored as binary files ready for cleaning. The green highlighting in figure 5.2A shows an example with three years of data from two different sites.\nThe clean_tv file is automatically created, and will be located in each Raw/Clean folder. This a standardized time vector of 30-minute frequency. This formats the timestamp of each record in Local Standard Time (LST; as required by AmeriFlux). \n\n\nWe advise you to generalize your scripts as far as possible, based on the sites and data that you have, and remember to document your code thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn real applications, it is likely that users will have multiple input files from Flux and Met stations (daily, monthly, or annual files). It is also very often the case with active sites that new files are continuously being downloaded from the site and added to the data folder.\nTo facilitate data processing in those cases we use specialized functions that can deal with multiple files and keep track of which files have changes since the last database update and update only those. That way raw data folders can contain thousands of files without affecting the speed of the database updates.\nUpdating Flux data\nHere is an example of how to update database from any files in the Sites/siteID/Flux folder that match a file pattern (in this case eddypro_TUT_*.csv).\n%% Processing multiple EddyPro files from the same folder \nprojectPath = 'E:\\Pipeline_Projects\\TUT_Project'; \nstructProject = set_TAB_project(projectPath); \nsiteID = 'TUT'; \nFluxDatabase_Pth = fullfile(structProject.databasePath, 'yyyy', siteID,'Flux'); \nprogressListPth = fullfile(structProject.sitesPath,siteID,'Flux','EddyPro_progressList.mat'); \nfilePattern = fullfile(structProject.sitesPath,siteID,'Flux','eddypro_TUT_*.csv'); \noptionsFileRead.flagFileType = 'fulloutput'; \nmissingPointValue = NaN; \ntimeUnit = '30MIN'; \n[nFiles,nHHours]=fr_EddyPro_database(filePattern,progressListPth,FluxDatabase_Pth,[],timeUnit,missingPointValue,optionsFileRead); \nfprintf('  %s - Flux  Number of files processed = %d, Number of HHours = %d\\n',siteID,nFiles,nHHours); \n\nYou will need to change the projectPath and maybe also the filePattern, if yours is different, before running this code.\n\nUpdating Met data\nIf we then wanted to process met data from Sites/siteID/Met folder (using the same projectPath, structProject and siteID) with the file-name pattern matching: TUT_MET.* we could run the following script:\n%% Processing multiple TOA5 files from the same folder \nMetDatabase_Pth = fullfile(structProject.databasePath, 'yyyy', siteID,'Met'); \nprogressListPth = fullfile(structProject.sitesPath,siteID,'Met','Met_progressList.mat'); \nfilePattern = fullfile(structProject.sitesPath,siteID,'Met','TUT_MET.*'); \nmissingPointValue = NaN; \ntimeUnit = '30MIN'; \n[nFiles,nHHours]=fr_TOA5_database(filePattern,progressListPth,MetDatabase_Pth,[],timeUnit,missingPointValue);  \nfprintf('  %s - Met  Number of files processed = %d, Number of HHours = %d\\n',siteID,nFiles,nHHours); \n\n If we run the same sequence twice (fr_TOA5_database or fr_EddyPro_database as shown above), the second time the number of files processed would be zero assuming that there were no new files added to the Sites folder between the two runs. If on the other hand, one of the files changed, the function would process it. That is how real-time data gets processed in this data pipeline.\nOther examples of Biomet.net functions that update data continuously, and can be written into a script as previously shown, are as follows:\n\nfr_HOBO_database (continuously create database from HOBO met data);\nfr_SmartFlux_database (continuously create database from SmartFlux output; flux data);\nfr_SoilFluxPro_database (continuously create database from SoilFluxPro output data).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData from Canadian meteorological stations [operational climate stations run by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)] can be used for gap-filling met data for Canadian flux sites that are in close proximity. If you have gaps in your met data, you can search for nearby climate stations as follows:\n\nTo find the closest Environment ECCC stations to your flux site, first go to this website: https://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html\nClick on the “Search by Proximity” tab (figure 5.2B), select “location coordinates in Decimal Degrees” and type in the coordinates of your flux site:\n\nFigure 5.2B. “Search by Proximity” tab on ECCC Historical Data website.\nWe advise selecting a station no more than 25 km away, but that is also up to the user’s judgement and their responsibility to justify.\nIt also helps to select a proper range of dates using either “with data available between” or “with data on” option.\nFrom the list of stations pick one that’s has “Hourly” data for the dates you need, and is closest to your location (see example in figure 5.2C):\n\nFigure 5.2C. Search results for selecting the station for gap-filling.\nIn this example, the closes would be “WINNIPEG THE FORKS”; click on “Go”, and make a note of the “Climate ID” number provided (figure 5.2D; in this case, the climate ID is 5023262).\n\nFigure 5.2D. Example of Hourly Data Report for Winnipeg The Forks, showing the Climate ID number.\nNext, you need the Station ID (which is different to the Climate ID). Go to this website: https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/climate/Get_More_Data_Plus_de_donnees/; open the Station Inventory EN.csv file and search on the Climate ID number that you saved. The number in the column to the right of this is the Station ID, which in the Winnipeg example is 28051. This Station ID will be used for the data downloads.\nCreate a script using the snippet below (download code snippet here or copy from below; we recommend adding this into your “main” do-it-all script introduced in section 4.2), and enter your Station ID and other relevant information (years and months). You can enter multiple station IDs at once.\n%% get Canadian ECCC station data\n structProject = set_TAB_project(projectPath); \n stationIDs = [28051]; \n yearsIn = 2022:2023; \n monthsIn  = 1:12; \n for cntStations = 1:length(stationIDs) \n     sID = stationIDs(cntStations); \n     pathECCC = fullfile('yyyy','ECCC',num2str(sID)); \n     try \n         run_ECCC_climate_station_update(yearsIn,monthsIn,sID,structProject.databasePath)     \n     catch \n         fprintf('Error processing station: %d (year: %d, month: %d)\\n',sID,yearsIn,monthsIn(end)); \n     end \n end\nRunning this script will create the database for the given station ID, for two years (2022 and 2023) in the current project folder. The new database for the station 28051 is located here: &lt;projectPath&gt;/Database/2022/ECCC/28051/30min/ (and similarly for 2023).\nAlternatively, if a user wants to create the ECCC database just for the current year, or to keep the climate data base up to date by downloading all the months between Jan and the current month, they can use this function call: run_ECCC_climate_station_update([],1:month(datetime),28051,db_pth_root).\nOr, for example, to update only the last two months of the current year: run_ECCC_climate_station_update([],month(datetime)-1:month(datetime),28051,db_pth_root).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor gap-filling met data for U.S. flux sites, you can use data from the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) climate stations if they are in close proximity.\nSome resources to find the nearest NCEI station and its ID:\n\nMap view of stations: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/search/data-search/global-hourly.\nStation list can be found at: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/isd-history.txt.\nStationID is the USAF and WBAN numbers combined into an 11-digit number.\n\nBelow is some sample code (download code snippet here or copy from below) where you should edit the stationsIDs (can be just one or more), UTC_offset, and yearRng parameters.

Some of these are listed in the tutorial under section 4.2, and section 6 provides extensive details of visualization tools for inspecting and analyzing raw and cleaned data.\nWhen you have confirmed that all the traces you expect to see are present in your newly created Database, you are ready to start cleaning the data.

    "text": "This section complements the quick-start set up in section 4.2.\nOn this page:\n\nBest practices\nUseful information on creating your database\nCreate Database From Multiple Input Files and Updates for Continuous Operational Sites\nCreate Database Using Data from Canadian Meteorological Stations\nCreate Database Using Data from U.S. Meteorological Stations\nVisualize and inspect your newly created database\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best-practice approach for each project is to have one “main” script for data processing (e.g., DataCleaning_Main.m). This script should contain all the steps that are needed to go from raw data to the final cleaned and gap-filled Ameriflux data set:\n\nObtaining/downloading the raw data (not covered here, we assume you have your own systems for obtaining datalogger output from your sites);\nCreating the database in the appropriate format (this current subsection);\nApplying the data-cleaning stages (subsections 5.3, 5.4, and 5.5).\n\n\nEach flux site is unique with its own sensors, data loggers, and data archiving formats (such as EddyPro output files, TOA5 Campbell Scientific files, Ameriflux CSV files, to name a few). The purpose of step 2 is to convert from such a site-specific dataset to a generic dataset ready to be processed using the standardised libraries (i.e., Biomet.net). These “generic” binary files can be read by most computer languages, by design, meaning they are suitable for the Biomet library which contains code written in Matlab, R, and Python.\nIf you need help getting started with your “main” computer program, a sample Matlab script is provided in the quick-start guide (section 4.2, under “Sample Code”). With that DataCleaning_Main.m script the entire data processing process is documented and it can be easily replicated. Insert as many informative comments as you can - it will help if the process needs to be reviewed later on or the project is handed over to another person. When working with your own data, especially for the first time using the pipeline, we still recommend following the steps in the tutorial as they also outline where to put your raw data files, and other important tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetermine the data format/source of raw data in your Sites directory.\nUse standard existing function(s) from the Biomet.net library, which you have already cloned/downloaded, to convert your raw data and create the database in Database directory. Examples of functions that can read your data and be used in your “main” script are as follows:\n\ndb_struct2database (create database from Matlab structure; flux or met data);\nfr_read_EddyPro_file (create database from EddyPro output; flux data);\nfr_read_TOA5_file (create database from TOA5 Campbell Scientific ASCII files);\nfr_read_generic_data_file (create database from most file formats).\n\n\n\n\nThe relevant function, when run in matlab, will create subdirectories named by data year (yearIn), then by SITEID (i.e., SITEIDs are grouped by year), as follows:\n\nFigure 5.2A. Directory tree showing structure of Database folder for multiple years and multiple sites under one project.\nThe SITEID subdirectories will be populated with data (e.g., Flux and Met if these data types exist) for the appropriate year, stored as binary files ready for cleaning. The green highlighting in figure 5.2A shows an example with three years of data from two different sites.\nThe clean_tv file is automatically created, and will be located in each Raw/Clean folder. This a standardized time vector of 30-minute frequency. This formats the timestamp of each record in Local Standard Time (LST; as required by AmeriFlux). \n\n\nWe advise you to generalize your scripts as far as possible, based on the sites and data that you have, and remember to document your code thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn real applications, it is likely that users will have multiple input files from Flux and Met stations (daily, monthly, or annual files). It is also very often the case with active sites that new files are continuously being downloaded from the site and added to the data folder.\nTo facilitate data processing in those cases we use specialized functions that can deal with multiple files and keep track of which files have changes since the last database update and update only those. That way raw data folders can contain thousands of files without affecting the speed of the database updates.\nUpdating Flux data\nHere is an example of how to update database from any files in the Sites/siteID/Flux folder that match a file pattern (in this case eddypro_TUT_*.csv).\n%% Processing multiple EddyPro files from the same folder \nprojectPath = 'E:\\Pipeline_Projects\\TUT_Project'; \nstructProject = set_TAB_project(projectPath); \nsiteID = 'TUT'; \nFluxDatabase_Pth = fullfile(structProject.databasePath, 'yyyy', siteID,'Flux'); \nprogressListPth = fullfile(structProject.sitesPath,siteID,'Flux','EddyPro_progressList.mat'); \nfilePattern = fullfile(structProject.sitesPath,siteID,'Flux','eddypro_TUT_*.csv'); \noptionsFileRead.flagFileType = 'fulloutput'; \nmissingPointValue = NaN; \ntimeUnit = '30MIN'; \n[nFiles,nHHours]=fr_EddyPro_database(filePattern,progressListPth,FluxDatabase_Pth,[],timeUnit,missingPointValue,optionsFileRead); \nfprintf('  %s - Flux  Number of files processed = %d, Number of HHours = %d\\n',siteID,nFiles,nHHours); \n\nYou will need to change the projectPath and maybe also the filePattern, if yours is different, before running this code.\n\nUpdating Met data\nIf we then wanted to process met data from Sites/siteID/Met folder (using the same projectPath, structProject and siteID) with the file-name pattern matching: TUT_MET.* we could run the following script:\n%% Processing multiple TOA5 files from the same folder \nMetDatabase_Pth = fullfile(structProject.databasePath, 'yyyy', siteID,'Met'); \nprogressListPth = fullfile(structProject.sitesPath,siteID,'Met','Met_progressList.mat'); \nfilePattern = fullfile(structProject.sitesPath,siteID,'Met','TUT_MET.*'); \nmissingPointValue = NaN; \ntimeUnit = '30MIN'; \n[nFiles,nHHours]=fr_TOA5_database(filePattern,progressListPth,MetDatabase_Pth,[],timeUnit,missingPointValue);  \nfprintf('  %s - Met  Number of files processed = %d, Number of HHours = %d\\n',siteID,nFiles,nHHours); \n\n If we run the same sequence twice (fr_TOA5_database or fr_EddyPro_database as shown above), the second time the number of files processed would be zero assuming that there were no new files added to the Sites folder between the two runs. If on the other hand, one of the files changed, the function would process it. That is how real-time data gets processed in this data pipeline.\nOther examples of Biomet.net functions that update data continuously, and can be written into a script as previously shown, are as follows:\n\nfr_HOBO_database (continuously create database from HOBO met data);\nfr_SmartFlux_database (continuously create database from SmartFlux output; flux data);\nfr_SoilFluxPro_database (continuously create database from SoilFluxPro output data).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData from Canadian meteorological stations [operational climate stations run by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)] can be used for gap-filling met data for Canadian flux sites that are in close proximity.

    "title": "EcoFlux Lab",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This page contains significant features recently added to the data cleaning pipeline - most recent at the top.\n\n\n\nNew Third Stage YML template:\nWe improved error messaging for third stage cleaning, including passing more information to the log file and to the Matlab output display. You need to be using the most recent site-specific YML template for the third stage to run. The updated template is available in section 4.3 under “Download INI/config template files”.\nNew Overwrite feature:\nSometimes we need to overwrite multiple properties for one or more traces that have already been created e.g. in an include file. The global variables feature allows this, however, once this section becomes long with many trace property tweaks, it can become very hard to troubleshoot, and in these cases having all the information for one trace together is more desirable.\nInstead of using global variables you can duplicate the full trace ([Trace] ... [End]), and in your site-specific first stage INI file, put this duplicate after the line of code where the include file is called that contains your original trace. Note the additional Overwrite property highlighted in yellow:\n\nFigure 7.2A. Location within site-specific INI file to put duplicate trace for overwriting a trace previously defined in an include INI file. In this case, we want to overwrite the CH4_MIXING_RATIO trace that was originally defined in EddyPro_LI7700_FirstStage_include.ini. Yellow highlighting shows the syntax for the “overwrite” property.\nThere are three overwrite options:\n\n0 = do not overwrite with this trace. This is the default setting. If you do not include the Overwrite parameter, the pipeline assumes this option. If you have a duplicate trace you will get an error during cleaning (Example 1):\n\n1 = overwrite traces having the same variableName and also with Overwrite = 0 setting. This puts the duplicate data where the original data was, i.e., complete overwrite, first trace gone. Use this setting if you want your duplicate T2 available to use in a later variable such as T3, T4, T5, etc. (Example 2):\n\n2 = overwrite traces having the same variableName and with Overwrite = 0 setting. This takes advantage of the “position” of the duplicate trace. Use this setting if you want a later variable such as T3 or T4 available to use in T2.\n\n\n\nNew postEvaluate property:\nMore complex user-defined processing can be applied in the first stage to any trace using the very useful “Evaluate” and new “postEvaluate” options. Matlab functions (user-written or from Biomet.net) can be called from this statement. Multiple Matlab statements can be called from within the “Evaluate” or “postEvaluate” strings. They can be used to derive variables from available data, flag variables to remove bad data, or to calculate new useful variables. Here is an Evaluate example for removing outliers from a trace:\nEvaluate = 'wlen=24;thres=4;TA_1_1_1 = run_std_dev(TA_1_1_1,clean_tv,wlen,thres);'\nThe Evaluate property is executed for all traces before any other cleaning properties, e.g., minMax, calibration, etc.. In contrast, the newer postEvaluate property is executed in the first stage after all other cleaning is done.\nGenerally speaking, the order of operations is: Evaluate –&gt; other cleaning (e.g., minMax, calibration) –&gt; postEvaluate.

    "text": "This page contains significant features recently added to the data cleaning pipeline - most recent at the top.\n\n\n\nNew Third Stage YML template:\nWe improved error messaging for third stage cleaning, including passing more information to the log file and to the Matlab output display. You need to be using the most recent site-specific YML template for the third stage to run. The updated template is available in section 4.3 under “Download INI/config template files”.\nNew Overwrite feature:\nSometimes we need to overwrite multiple properties for one or more traces that have already been created e.g. in an include file. The global variables feature allows this, however, once this section becomes long with many trace property tweaks, it can become very hard to troubleshoot, and in these cases having all the information for one trace together is more desirable.\nInstead of using global variables you can duplicate the full trace ([Trace] ... [End]), and in your site-specific first stage INI file, put this duplicate after the line of code where the include file is called that contains your original trace. Note the additional Overwrite property highlighted in yellow:\n\nFigure 7.2A. Location within site-specific INI file to put duplicate trace for overwriting a trace previously defined in an include INI file. In this case, we want to overwrite the CH4_MIXING_RATIO trace that was originally defined in EddyPro_LI7700_FirstStage_include.ini. Yellow highlighting shows the syntax for the “overwrite” property.\nThere are three overwrite options:\n\n0 = do not overwrite with this trace. This is the default setting. If you do not include the Overwrite parameter, the pipeline assumes this option. If you have a duplicate trace you will get an error during cleaning (Example 1):\n\n1 = overwrite traces having the same variableName and also with Overwrite = 0 setting. This puts the duplicate data where the original data was, i.e., complete overwrite, first trace gone. Use this setting if you want your duplicate T2 available to use in a later variable such as T3, T4, T5, etc. (Example 2):\n\n2 = overwrite traces having the same variableName and with Overwrite = 0 setting. This takes advantage of the “position” of the duplicate trace. Use this setting if you want a later variable such as T3 or T4 available to use in T2.\n\n\n\nNew postEvaluate property:\nMore complex user-defined processing can be applied in the first stage to any trace using the very useful “Evaluate” and new “postEvaluate” options. Matlab functions (user-written or from Biomet.net) can be called from this statement. Multiple Matlab statements can be called from within the “Evaluate” or “postEvaluate” strings. They can be used to derive variables from available data, flag variables to remove bad data, or to calculate new useful variables. Here is an Evaluate example for removing outliers from a trace:\nEvaluate = 'wlen=24;thres=4;TA_1_1_1 = run_std_dev(TA_1_1_1,clean_tv,wlen,thres);'\nThe Evaluate property is executed for all traces before any other cleaning properties, e.g., minMax, calibration, etc.. In contrast, the newer postEvaluate property is executed in the first stage after all other cleaning is done.\nGenerally speaking, the order of operations is: Evaluate –&gt; other cleaning (e.g., minMax, calibration) –&gt; postEvaluate. This is regardless of the order that they appear  within [Trace] ... [End]. The following series of examples shows how the Evaluate and postEvaluate statements work in relation to the other cleaning properties. For each example the input (Original) is an array of ones, and both the “Original” and first-stage “Clean” data are plotted in the result.\nExample 1: Only minMax and calibration, no Evaluate or postEvaluate statements\n\nResult: x = 2x [calibrated]\n\n\nExample 2: Evaluate, minMax and calibration, no postEvaluate statement\n\nResult: x = (x - 1)*2 [Evaluate first, then calibrate]\n\n\nExample 3: minMax and calibration, postEvaluate statement, no Evaluate statement\n\nResult: x = 2x - 1 [calibrate, then postEvaluate]\n\n\nExample 4: minMax and calibration, both Evaluate and postEvaluate statements\n\nResult: x = (x - 1)*2 - 1 [Evaluate, then calibrate, then postEvaluate]",

    "text": "What is a Branch?\n\n\nBranches can be thought of like limbs on a tree, or perhaps a more accurate analogy can be taken from hydrology, by comparing them to an anbranching river channel.\n\nBranches are separate “streams” of code that break off of the main “channel”. Some branches may be dead ends that don’t end up going anywhere. While some branches may lead lead to improvements that can be incorporated back into the main branch of the codebase. Others may break off from the main project entirely.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn anabranching section of the Mackenzie River Delta.\n\n\n\n\n\nBranch Protection Rules\nWe use branch protection rules to protect the main codebase. All changes to the main branch of a protected repository, must be submitted via a “pull request” using a separate branch. This allows for review of the changes by other users before changes are incorporated. It adds an extra level of security by protecting the main branch of code from the erroneous keystrokes of novice and expert users alike! These rules are act as a “gate” that helps ensure any changes to operational code are intentional and agreed upon by relevant parties. If you try to push (force) a change to the main branch of a protected repository on our GitHub, you’ll be given an error message and told to submit a pull request instead!

    "text": "Common Git Tasks\n\nCreating a Repo From Scratch\nSay you have a collection of code that you want to add to a local repository. The syntax would be as follows:\ngit init -b main\ngit add some_program.py\ngit commit -am \"First Commit: Adding my initial code to repo\"\nWhat is happening here?\ninit: Creates an empty repository with a “branch” (-b) named “main”\nadd: indicates that “some_program.py” will be tracked within the repo. Other files in the repo will not be tracked unless you explicitly add them. Alternatively bash git add . would all all files within the repo. There are more complex patterns that can be setup to explicitly exclude/include some files using “.gitignore” files, but that’s a topic for another day.\ncommit: Tells git to “save” a permanent copy of all (-a) tracked files in the repo in there current state and leave a commit message (-m) to leave important notes about the commit. Commit messages are extremely helpful, both for reminding yourself what happened, and indicating to collaborators what’s included in a commit.\n\nYou should avoid leaving short/nondescript commit messages such as “updated code”, because that doesn’t help anyone\nIt is good practice to make a commit any time you make an important change to your project!\n\n\nAdding Your New Repository to GitHub\nGo to github.com and follow the steps outlined in the images bellow:\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Create a new repository\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Give it the same name as your local repo. Accept all defaults then click create.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. The next window will open an empty repo. Copy the url go back to your local git repo and execute the commands listed bellow.\n\n\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/June-Skeeter/SomeTest.git\ngit push --set-upstream origin main\nThese commands will tell your local git where the remote (on the cloud) version of your repository is located and then “push” your local copy to the cloud. If you go back to the github repo and refresh the webpage, you’ll see that whatever files were in your local copy are now visible remotely!",

    "text": "Working With an Existing Repository\nMore often than not, you’ll end up working with an existing repository. You may need to make some changes, which can be added back to the main branch (following the branch protection rules!) or you may just need to run some fully developed code locally on your computer. For example, maybe you need to do some processing for the HOGG site in Manitoba. You can “download” a local copy of the repo and create a branch for your local changes as follows:\ngit clone https://github.com/ubc-micromet/Calculation_Procedures.git\ngit checkout -b MyHoggUpdates\nWhat is happening here?\nclone:: Tells git to download a local copy a repository from a remote location (i.e. a github URL) to your computer.\ncheckout: Tells git to create an new branch (-b) with the name “MyHoggUpdates”. This branch will contain all of your own adjustments, but the main branch on your local machine will not be altered! If you break something (e.g., delete an important code block), its easy to go back to the main branch. Just type bash git checkout main to go back in to the main branch. Note only need to add bash -b after bash checkout when creating a new branch. Git will automatically revert all files in the repo the the main version.\n\nContributing your Changes\nProvided you have permission to write to the repository (this is granted on a per-user basis by repo “owners”), you can contribute any changes you make by pushing a copy of your branch to github. Say you added a new file “new_HOGG_file.ini”, you could add it, commit it, then push to git hub as follows:\ngit add new_HOGG_file.ini\ngit commit -am \"A relevant description of your changes\"\ngit push --set-upstream origin MyHoggUpdates\nNote you only need to run the --set-upstream origin Test once per branch. The second, third, hundredth push you can simply type git push\n\n\nPulling Remote Changes\nSay there were some important updates to the main remote branch that you need to incorporate to code on your local branch. Starting from within MyHoggUpdates You could:\ngit checkout main\ngit pull\ngit checkout MyHoggUpdates\ngit merge main\npull downloads all the changes from the main branch on github to your local machine.\nmerge will automatically incorporate any changes for files that don’t conflict with changes you’ve made to files locally. i.e., if you’re working on “new_HOGG_file.ini”, but someone else changed “existing_BB_file.ini” then the updates to “existing_BB_file.ini” will be brought in without causing any “merge conflicts”. If you also made an edit to “existing_BB_file.ini” that does not match the incoming change, it will create a merge conflict, that needs to be resolved manually.",

This is useful if you broke something and want to “go back” to the way things were. You can give a specific file name after\ngit revert HEAD~n\nrevert allows you go back any “n” number of commits, bash Head~2 would go back to the state you had two commits ago.\nIssues: Opening issues on GitHub allows us to delegate work, discuss task and keep notes on various features.\n\nThey can be labeled as bugs, upgrade requests, etc.\n\nIssues can be assigned to one or more members of the organization, and you can leave comments to discuss issues.\nAn issue remains open until they are “closed”.\n\nGitHub Pages: GitHub can be used to render static sites (like this one).

We combine field-based measurements, remote sensing, and modelling to investigate land-atmosphere interactions in our rapidly changing world, with a current emphasis on wetland ecosystems.\nWetlands provide a wide range of ecosystem services, among which climate regulation is considered one of the most important to society. They play a critical role in the global carbon cycle by sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide over long timescales, while also being the largest natural source of methane. Despite their importance, the consequences of rising temperatures and other climate perturbations on wetland GHG fluxes remain uncertain. Preventing wetland loss and advancing restoration efforts have been recognized by scientists and policymakers alike as key strategies for reducing future emissions and meeting global climate goals.\nMy interdisciplinary research addresses these knowledge gaps by quantifying how wetland responses to climate variability and restoration influence GHG exchange. Through collaborative projects, I investigate the drivers and dynamics of wetland GHG fluxes at multiple scales and evaluate the climate mitigation potential of wetland conservation and restoration. This work provides critical insights for improving predictions of wetland contributions to the global climate system and supports climate policy development, including national greenhouse gas inventories and nature-based climate solutions.",

It focuses on measuring and modelling GHG fluxes across a range of wetland types in southern Quebec – including open and forested bogs, forested swamps, and freshwater marshes – under both natural and disturbed conditions. It represents the largest and most comprehensive assessment of wetland carbon dynamics undertaken in Canada. Our team is using a combination of eddy covariance, chamber-based flux measurements, and lateral carbon flux monitoring to quantify the full carbon budget of these systems under varying hydrological and land-use regimes. The project aims to generate high-quality empirical data, coupled with modelling tools and management frameworks, to inform and enable the deployment of evidence-based, verifiable, and scalable wetland-based climate solutions. The results will directly support Quebec’s Plan pour une économie verte and Canada’s national climate adaptation and mitigation strategies by providing robust assessments of the capacity wetland restoration and conservation to contribute to GHG reduction goals.\nCARBONIQUE in the news:  Radio-Canada - Les tourbières, alliées insoupçonnées contre la crise climatique  Video of the CARBONIQUE team setting up two peatland towers  La force cachée des marécages  Le Devoir - Actualités UQAM \n\n\nCarbon Fluxes in a Restored Peatland\n\nIn collaboration with several other research groups, my lab’s research is focused on measuring GHG, water, and energy fluxes over Burns Bog, a restored peatland in Metro Vancouver. This site is a raised domed peat bog that is undergoing re-wetting as a restoration management strategy following peat harvesting and associated drainage. While restoration can help recover important ecosystems services provided by wetlands, it can also affect the exchange of greenhouse gases, water and energy between the surface and the atmosphere.\n\nBy conducting year-round eddy covariance measurements, we are assessing the biogeochemical and biophysical impacts of peatland restoration, and the impacts of forest fire smoke on carbon cycling and energy fluxes in restored peatlands. This research is also being done in collaboration with researchers and staff at Metro Vancouver who are interested in quantifying the climate mitigation potential of wetland restoration and conservation. \nCollaborators:  UBC Ecohydrology Research Group  UBC Biometeorology and Soil Physics Group  Dan Moore’s Research Group, UBC Geography \nBurns Bog in the news:  Up in smoke: Human activities are fuelling wildfires that burn essential carbon-sequestering peatlands  David Suzuki: For climate’s sake, save the peat!  Carbon Neutral Achievement Sets Stage for Bold Climate Action \n\n\nBlue Carbon Research\n\nBlue carbon is the carbon sequestered and stored in coastal ecosystems including tidal marshes, mangroves, and seagrasses. Coastal ecosystems are among the strongest carbon sinks in the biosphere. This coupled with their potential for low methane emissions, has generated widespread interest in these ecosystems for climate change mitigation and adaptation. However, measuring and modelling carbon exchanges in tidal wetlands presents unique challenges due to highly dynamic atmospheric and hydrological fluxes, as well as sensitivities to both terrestrial and marine influences.\nMy research group installed the first two eddy covariance flux towers (CA-DSM and CA-RBM) in tidal wetlands along the Pacific Coast of Canada to quantify and model the net carbon and GHG balance of these marshes, which represent an important data gap in ecosystem-scale measurements of GHG exchange from tidal marshes. In partnership West Coast Environmental Law, we are also working to translate this blue carbon science into policy-relevant information for municipalities and provincial governments. \n\nOur research group is also involved in the NSF funded Coastal Carbon Research Coordination Network. Specifically, we are involved in the Methane Working Group, which aims to compile all methane flux data from coastal habitats (excluding mangroves) in the CONUS to parameterize and validate a set of nested process-based methane models. \nAdditionally, we are part of a U.S. Department of Energy grant “High-frequency Data Integration for Landscape Model Calibration of Carbon Fluxes Across Diverse Tidal Marshes” focused on leveraging eddy covariance observations to improve landscape-scale models of carbon fluxes across tidal marshes. This grant, led by Dr. Patty Oikawa brings together university and government researchers from across the U.S. \nI am also a co-investigator on a collaborative research effort to model the current and future mitigation capacity of Canada’s blue carbon ecosystems, which is funded by an NSERC Alliance grant. The project is led by Julia Baum (University of Victoria), and includes four co-principal investigators and seventeen collaborators from across the country which are contributing to this national natural ocean climate solutions research effort. The project brings together a consortium of four universities, three government agencies, and four eNGOs. \n\n\nFreshwater mineral soil wetlands as Nature-based Climate Solutions\n\nAs part of a national collaboration funded by Environment and Climate Change Canada’s Climate Action and Awareness Fund and a previous NSERC Alliance grant, I am co-leading GHG flux monitoring at three freshwater mineral soil (FWMS) wetlands in Canada, including three long-term eddy covariance sites in Manitoba co-managed with Ducks Unlimited and one in Quebec. My research in this project focuses on measuring and synthesizing GHG fluxes from these wetlands to inform biogeochemical models and guide management strategies aimed at reducing emissions. A key contribution of this work is the development of decision-support tools, such as a GHG calculator, to quantify emission reductions resulting from the conservation and restoration of FWMS wetlands as NbCS.\nFWMS wetland research in the news:  University of Toronto Scarborough News  Project intended to demonstrate wetlands’ greenhouse gas impact  DUC analyzing wetlands on farms and ranches for carbon capture  DUC Carbon Tower Project \n\n\nFLUXNET-CH4 – a global database of eddy covariance CH\\(_4\\) flux measurements and wetland synthesis for CH4\nNatural wetlands are the largest, yet most uncertain, natural source of CH\\(_4\\) to the atmosphere. Eddy covariance measurements of CH\\(_4\\) fluxes are important for constraining CH\\(_4\\) budgets, understanding the response of CH\\(_4\\) fluxes to environmental factors and climate, and creating validation datasets for the land-surface models used to infer global CH\\(_4\\) budgets. Unlike well-coordinated efforts for synthesizing carbon dioxide (CO\\(_2\\)) flux tower observations (e.g., FLUXNET), no such network and data synthesis effort existed previously for CH\\(_4\\). As part of an initiative coordinated through the Global Carbon Project in close partnership with AmeriFlux, EuroFlux, and FLUXNET, we compiled a global database of eddy covariance CH\\(_4\\) flux measurements to answer regional and global questions related to the global CH\\(_4\\) cycle. Through this activity, I coordinated the collection, aggregation, standardization, and post-processing of global methane data from the flux tower community. FLUXNET-CH4 Version 1.0 includes data from 79 sites, representing freshwater, coastal, upland, natural, and managed ecosystems. Version 1.0 of the database is publicly available. \n\nWe used FLUXNET-CH4 data to assess global freshwater wetland coverage. As expected, current sites represent bioclimatic attributes well in arctic, boreal, and temperate regions, but are sparse in humid tropical areas—where CH\\(_4\\) fluxes are typically highest and most uncertain. To better constrain tropical CH\\(_4\\) emissions and their role in rising atmospheric CH\\(_4\\), expanded observational coverage is urgently needed. To fill this gap, we are expanding FLUXNET-CH4 to include additional sites, with a focus on tropical flux towers. For more information on submitting data to FLUXNET-CH4 V2.0, please see here. \nAdditionally, through a USGS Powell Center Working Group, we leveraged FLUXNET-CH4 V1.0 to provide novel insights into the controls and timing of wetland CH4 emissions for North America and globally, inform and validate biogeochemical models, and upscale wetland CH4 flux measurements globally. \nCollaborators:  Global Carbon Project  AmeriFlux  FLUXNET  Jackson Lab, Stanford University  Terrestrial Carbon Cycle Group, Stanford University Stanford Machine Learning Group  PUCP, Dr. Eric Cosio and Dr. Norma Salinas  UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Dr. Carole Helfter  Okavango Research Institute, Dr. Mangaliso Gondwe  LBNL, Dr. Robinson Negron-Juarez  INRAE, Dr. Damien Bonal  Mamirauá Institute for Sustainable Development, Dr. Ayan Fleischmann",

Schedule a site visit if it’s decreasing rapidly (&lt;10%). It’s normal for 7700’s signal strength to drop during rainy periods, but it’s not normal for 7200’s to drop that frequently (if it does, check the 7200 head’s o-ring).\n\nVoltage\n\nLook at data over the past month and tell June or Rick if the battery voltage goes below 24 V at midnight.\n\nThis usually happens in the winter when we have a few days of clouds & rain.",

    "text": "This section provides extensive details beyond the first-time set up in section 4, to help more advanced users. If you are creating INI files for the first time, we highly recommend following our quick-start tutorial: instructions for INI file creation begin in section 4.3.\nOn this page:\n\nWhat are INI files?\nGeneral outline for creating first stage INI file\nRunning first stage cleaning in Matlab\nProperties and parameters: first stage INI\nTags for dependent variables\nGlobal variables and include files\nOutlier detection\nOverwrite feature\nMore about Evaluate and postEvaluate: order of operations\nFlags for removing periods of data\nCreating INI files from Ameriflux data\nProgramming syntax rules for first and second stage INI files\nTips\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe INI files for a given flux site dictate how data is transferred from its raw format into a standardized, clean, and gap-filled format that can be used for scientific analysis. They provide instructions to a set of MATLAB and R scripts used to process data. Even though flux sites can be similar in set up, they are usually unique in some way (different sensors, loggers, record lengths, etc.), and the INI files provide a way to deal with these differences while standardizing the data across sites.\nThere are three files, one for each data cleaning stage. Before starting to create your own INI files, it is important that you complete all of section 2, read section 3, and complete sections 4.1 and 4.2 (which each have supplementary information in sections 5.1 and 5.2, respectively), so that you have the best chance of everything running smoothly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are doing this for the first time, you can obtain simplified template files from the quick-start instructions in section 4.3, and we recommend that you follow the tutorial in that section. These are the general steps to create your first stage INI (which usually requires the most work of the three stages):\n\nUsing your duplicated first stage INI file or downloaded template file, rename it using your unique measurement site ID. For example, the first stage INI file for a site with siteID = ‘DSM’ is named DSM_FirstStage.ini. This exact naming convention is important for the pipeline libraries to locate and use the file.\nEdit this first stage INI file, adding just a few variables at a time and test as you go (see subsection “Running first stage cleaning in Matlab” later on this page), before adding more variables. This will make troubleshooting much easier. The tutorial in section 4.3 gives step-by-step instructions for adding variables.\nDetails on INI file properties and parameters are listed in table 5.1 on this page.\nIn addition to the data cleaning principles previously outlined in section 3, keep in mind the following guidelines:\n\nSelect traces that are needed for future data analysis. Not all the measured variables from a site need to be here, only the ones that will be used in future analysis or those needed to improve cleaning, such as diagnostic variables.\nEach first stage trace name should follow Ameriflux guidelines including positional qualifiers where relevant. Filenames from your raw database can be renamed here.\nThe original values can be altered; calibrations can be applied; units can be changed.\nApply basic filtering: (a) values can be removed if they exceed minMax thresholds; (b) values can be clamped to the thresholds if they exceed clampedMinMax values.\nYou can create dependencies between different traces. If one trace has some data points removed, all its dependent traces will also have those data points removed.\nMore complex user-defined processing can be applied to the trace using the very useful “Evaluate” option (also available in second stage cleaning). Matlab functions (user-written or Biomet.net) can be called from this statement. Multiple Matlab statements can be called from within the “Evaluate” string. \n\nExample for air temperature trace: if you have an output variable from a Campbell Scientific data logger that represents your 2-m air temperature measurement named MET_HMP_T_2m_Avg, you would assign this variable name to the inputFileName parameter (figure 5.3A; yellow highlighted text). In this example, it would be renamed in this stage using the variableName parameter, as TA_1_1_1, following the Ameriflux naming convention.\n\nFigure 5.3A. Air temperature trace (TA_1_1_1) as defined in a first stage INI file, with input from MET_HMP_T_2m_Avg variable.\nOther fields that need editing are highlighted in peach:\n\nGive a descriptive title to your trace;\nInput the start date of measurements for this variable in matlab’s datenum format (YYYY,MM,DD);\nInput the source folder into measurementType (Met/Flux/other; these should match up with different measurement systems, i.e., Met for the Campbell Scientific data example, and Flux for EddyPro data);\nCheck the units;\nIf known, input the instrument model and serial number (SN);\nImportantly, choose minMax bounds that are appropriate for the climate of your site (values outside this range will become NaNs).\nFor details of all the parameters and their definitions, see the “Properties and parameters: first stage INI” subsection below.\n\nIf you have more than one air temperature measurement, you would create more traces to assign these, and use the Ameriflux naming convention to distinguish and define their relative positions (figure 5.3B). \n\nFigure 5.3B. Second air temperature trace (TA_1_2_1) defined in the same first stage INI file, in this case for a different vertical position (height of 350 cm), with input from MET_HMP_T_350cm_Avg variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have a few variables in your INI file, test it by running the fr_automated_cleaning.m function in Matlab (part of Biomet.net library), using the following command:\nfr_automated_cleaning_(yearIn,'SITEID',1)\nwhere the arguments are defined as follows:\nTable 5.3A. Argument definitions for fr_automated_cleaning function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nDescription\nType\n\n\n\n\nyearIn\nyear(s) you wish to clean data for\ninteger or integer array\n\n\nSITEID\nmeasurement site ID, e.g., ‘DSM’\nstring uppercase\n\n\ncleaning stage to run\n1 = first stage, 2 = second stage, 7 = third stage, 8 = convert to AmeriFlux CSV file\ninteger\n\n\n\nFor example, to run first stage cleaning for the DSM site for 2022, you would type: fr_automated_cleaning(2022,'DSM',1).\nWith this function, you can clean multiple years of data, e.g., 2020:2023, and once you have your INI files set up for later cleaning stages you can also run multiple stages e.g., [1 2 7]. Earlier stages must have been run at least once before running subsequent stages, so the appropriate data files exist as input for the next stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.3B. First stage INI file properties and parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nHeader/Comments\n“%” character indicates the beginning of a comment. Program will not process any characters that follow “%”. Use comments to add information and to better document the site. Each line of the INI file can be followed by a comment. Refer to the sample INI file for DSM site.\n\n\nSite_name\nName of the site. Any text can go here.\n\n\nSiteID\nThis is the name attributed to the site in the database (e.g., DSM). Must be uppercase.\n\n\nDifference_GMT_to_local_time\nTime difference between GMT time, that database is kept in, and the standard time at the site location. local_time+Difference_GMT_to_local_time -&gt; GMT time.\n\n\n[Trace]\nMarks the beginning of a new variable. The section has to end with the keyword [End].\n\n\nvariableName\nName of variable for first stage, following the Ameriflux naming convention. The variable with this name will show up in the subfolder “Clean” under the same folder where the original database file came from.\n\n\ntitle\nDescriptive variable name for plots/visualization.\n\n\ninputFileName\n{inputFileName} The name of the database file that contains data for this trace. The brackets are mandatory. The file name can include folder(s), e.g., 'Met/Tair', and the paths are relative to the main site path (./Database/yyyy/SITEID), so the above example translates into this filepath: './Database/yyyy/SITEID/Met/Tair'.Over the lifetime of a measurement site, the data logger programs can change and a sensor measurement that was assigned to a variable may change. To allow for different variable names over the site history the inputFileName can be given as: {'inputFileName1','inputFileName2'}. In this case, the parameter inputFileName_dates must be present and reflect this (see next parameter description). Advanced: if there is a need to load up a data file from an alternative site, the path can be constructed as follows: ../../SITEID2/dataFolder. This syntax ../../ moves the path pointer up two directory levels to /Database/yyyy and from there SITEID2/dataFolder takes the program to the correct folder.\n\n\ninputFileName_dates\n[datenum_start1 datenum_end1; datenum_start2 datenum_end2] The start and end dates of data periods for each of the inputFileNames, using the Matlab datenum function. If there are multiple inputFileNames per the example in the previous parameter description, e.g., {'inputFileName1','inputFileName2'} then the program needs to know the time periods when the data assigned to the variableName should come from inputFileName1, and when from inputFileName2. In that case, this field is mandatory. If the inputFileName parameter contains only one file name, this inputFileName_dates parameter is optional, but it is still a good practice to use it anyway for documentation purposes and in case other filenames are added in the future. The last datenum_end is usually set far into the future, e.g., datenum(2999,1,1).\n\n\nmeasurementType\nUsually 'Met' or 'Flux' (must be of Matlab type char). Mandatory parameter that sets the input and output trace folders. The input folder defaults to: SITEID/measurementType/inputFileName. If relative paths are used for the inputFileName parameter defined previously, the pipeline code “assumes” that the current folder is SITEID/measurementType, so the relative path is referenced to that. The output folder for the first stage cleaned trace is always SITEID/measurementType/Clean. Note: the measurementType must not be missing (empty), otherwise the data will be saved to SITEID/Clean/variableName which is incorrect and will cause errors in future cleaning stages.\n\n\nunits\nMeasurement units for this trace must be data type char. Important!\n\n\ninstrument\nThe name of the sensor that measures this trace, e.g., 'HMP155A'\n\n\ninstrumentSN\nSerial number of the sensor, if available.\n\n\nEvaluate\nOptional user-defined function. Examples: can be used to derive variables from available data; in flag variables to remove bad data; or for calculating new useful variables, e.g., Evaluate = 'TA_1_1_1 = shiftMyData(clean_tv,TA_1_1_1,datenum(2021,11,07,03,00,0),60);'. \n\n\npostEvaluate\nOptional user-defined function, intended for more complex cases. Same functionality as Evaluate property, but postEvaluate is executed after all the other Trace properties. \n\n\nloggedCalibration\nUsed together with currentCalibration (see next parameter). If you need to change the linear calibration for the trace, these coefficients are used to convert the trace values from engineering units to their original/raw units. Then the correct calibration coefficients (currentCalibration) are used. This can also be used to change the units. The format is [gain offset startDatenum endDatenum], where startDatenum and endDatenum refer to the time span that this particular set of coefficients should be applied. For example, with no change for data starting on 1 January 2020, the code would read loggedCalibration = [1 0 datenum(2020,1,1) datenum(2999,1,1)]. You can apply multiple calibrations to different time periods, separated by semicolons. Note: all calibration values need to be on the same line of code, i.e., no line-breaks are allowed in the INI file!\n\n\ncurrentCalibration\nCorrect(ed) linear calibration coefficients. Used together with loggedCalibrations (see notes for previous parameter for more details).\n\n\ncomments\nAny useful comments relating to this trace and its handling in the INI file, such as why certain flags are applied.\n\n\nminMax\n[min max] Minimum and maximum numerical thresholds for filtering. The values outside of this range will be set to NaN.\n\n\nclamped_minMax\n[cMin cMax] Similar to minMax but instead of setting the data points outside the range to NaN, it truncates their value to the cMin or cMax. (e.g., RH: [0 100]).Note: this parameter is not mandatory, however, when used, please make sure that the minMax property boundaries are wider than the boundaries of clamped_minMax because the minMax property is applied first. This parameter is useful for variables such as relative humidity, e.g., minMax = [-1 110] used with clamped_minMax=[0 100].\n\n\nzeroPt\nValue to indicate missing data. Many programs nowadays use -9999 to indicate bad/missing data points.\n\n\ndependent\nFilter-dependent variables based on specified trace. The current trace can have multiple dependents that need to be separated by commas, e.g., dependent = 'trace1','trace2','trace3'.For example, when using the LI-7200 pump, all the traces that depend on the LI-7200 are dependent on the pump trace. So, for the LI-7200: dependent = 'CO2','H2O'. Then the CO2 trace should have dependent = 'FC',... and so on. You can write these out manually where necessary or where this only occurs once or twice, but we highly recommend using the “tags” feature for common dependencies that are recurring.\n\n\n[End]\nMarks the end of the properties section for each trace.\n\n\n\n Note: Other properties that a user wants to use later on in their own programs (or in the “Evaluate” statements) can be added to each of the traces. The function that processes the INI files (read_ini_files.m) will add the property and its assigned value to the trace structure, but the rest of the Trace Analysis programs will ignore it. The user can then parse the trace info in their own programs (or within “Evaluate” statements) and take advantage of this feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned in the “dependent” parameter description in Table 5.1, you can use the tags feature to ensure that your INI file “catches” and filters all common dependent variables. This feature utilizes the Biomet library function tags_Standard.m. You should list the relevant tag in the “dependent” property field for it to work.\nFor example, given the standard tags, if you put 'tag_H2O_All' in the dependent field for a trace, all traces listed under that tag will then be dependents of that trace. Tags can refer to other tags. You can also create site-specific custom tags by creating a SITEID_CustomTags.m, making sure to follow the same format as the tags in tags_Standard.m. (This optional file should live in the Derived_Variables folder; see figure 4.7 in section 5.1 for the location).\nTags in your site-specific custom file will overwrite tags of the same name in the tags_Standard.m file, and Matlab will warn you that this is occurring (by beeping and writing out a message to the screen).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo simplify entering and editing the required parameters into the first stage INI file, there is an option to apply the same setting to many traces at once, using the “global variables” feature. At the top of the first stage INI template file (obtained in section 4.3), you will notice sections with headers containing “Global variables”. These are always defined at the beginning of the first stage INI file.\nThe main advantage of this feature is that it allows you to define a standard set of variables in templates called “include” files, which can be loaded into each site-specific INI file using the #include statement. We have provided samples of typical Met and EddyPro include files in the quick-start tutorial.\nAnother advantage is that you can apply changes to multiple traces all at once if needed, by making only one edit at the top of the file and then referencing this addition. This way, you do not risk missing multiple traces needing the same edit, so long as it is referenced correctly.\nNote: only the main body of your first stage INI file, not your “include” files, should contain global variables.\nThere are two types of global variables, as follows:\n\nInstrument-specific (globalVars.Instrument):\n\n\nFor the instrument-specific global variables, each trace has an instrumentType field. Currently we use five default instrument types (six if we consider an empty field [] as a type): LI7200, LI7700, Anemometer, EC, and otherTraces.\nExample:\nglobalVars.Instrument.LI7200.instrumentSN  = '72H-1029'\napplies this serial number to every trace which includes instrumentType = 'LI7200'.\nYou can also create your own unique sensor option for instrumentType, if you need to apply a setting to multiple traces.\notherTraces has been depreciated so if an existing INI file contains this code (e.g., from an old template file), you can either set it to zero or remove those lines of code altogether (otherTraces.Enable = 0). If this is set to 1, you will get warnings when you run cleaning.\n\n\nTrace-specific (globalVars.Trace):\n\n\nExample:\nglobalVars.Trace.CH4.currentCalibration \n                  = [1000 0 datenum(2021,1,1) datenum(2999,1,1)]\napplies this current calibration to the trace with variableName = 'CH4'.\nDetailed explanation: in the INI file, the trace “CH4” has the field currentCalibration set to empty: currentCalibration = []. There is a global variable for the same trace with the correct currentCalibration field:\nglobalVars.Trace.CH4.currentCalibration \n                  = [1000 0 datenum(2021,1,1) datenum(2999,1,1)]\nThe final result is that the field currentCalibration for the trace “CH4” gets set to: currentCalibration = [1000 0 datenum(2021,1,1) datenum(2999,1,1)].\n\n\nOther (globalVars.other):\n\n\nFor the third type of global variable, e.g., globalVars.other, currently you can use this to carry out single-point interpolation, for cases where just one half-hourly data point is missing:\nglobalVars.other.singlePointInterpolation = 'on'  % 'no_interp' - skip interpolation [default], 'on' - do single missing point interpolation for all traces\n\nAdding include files to your First Stage INI file\nIn sections 4.1 and 4.2, we introduced include files and how they are obtained. These template files define a standard set of variables that can be loaded into your first stage INI file. Specifically, the files relate to EddyPro output and radiation components. We suggest browsing through these files to become familiar with the content. If you wish to change or add any settings, we strongly recommend leaving the template “include” files untouched and using the global variables feature to create or overwrite the relevant setting, as previously described.\nMore information about include files:\n\nEddyPro_Common_FirstStage_include.ini: includes traces common to EddyPro output, listed in EddyPro file output order;\nEddyPro_LI7200_FirstStage_include.ini: when an LI-7200 IRGA is being used, this file adds LI-7200 specific traces, listed in EddyPro file output order;\nEddyPro_LI7500_FirstStage_include.ini: when an LI-7500 IRGA is being used, this file adds LI-7500 specific traces, listed in EddyPro file output order;\nEddyPro_LI7500_FirstStage_include.ini: when an LI-7500 IRGA is being used, this file adds LI-7500 specific traces, listed in EddyPro file output order;\nRAD_FirstStage_include.ini: includes radiation components.\n\nTo include any of these files, add the following line of code to the very bottom of your first stage INI file: #include &lt;relevant_file&gt;_include.ini. If you are using more than one, put them on multiple lines of code, still at the very bottom of the INI file, as follows:\n#include EddyPro_Common_FirstStage_include.ini\n#include EddyPro_LI7200_FirstStage_include.ini\n#include RAD_FirstStage_include.ini\nHow the global variables algorithm works:\n\nThe INI file trace parameters, i.e., all fields between [TRACE] and [END] in the INI file, are loaded up.\nThe program then cycles through all the traces: for each trace, first it checks if the instrumentType field matches one of the globalVars.Instrument fields, e.g., for instrumentType = 'LI7700' measuring “CH4”, if there is a global.Instrument.LI7700 field, then all its fields would be applied to the CH4 trace, either creating a new field or overwriting the existing fields; i.e., the content of global.Instrument.LI7700.instrumentSN would replace the content of the CH4 field instrumentSN. Secondly, it checks if the trace variableName matches any of the globalVars.Trace fields, e.g. Trace “CH4”.\nThe program continues reading the INI file and applies all the settings from the [TRACE]-[END] section.\nNext, it cycles through all the globalVars.Instrument fields and creates the fields or overwrites them if they already exist.\nFinally, it goes through all the globalVars.Trace fields and creates or overwrites the fields.\nThen the program moves to the next trace and repeats steps 2–5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs outlined earlier on this page, the Evaluate feature can be used to implement Matlab code. This can be useful for removing outliers from your data in the first stage. For example, in the Biomet library there are some existing functions to help with this, such as:\n\nremove_spikes_diurnal_nonParametric.m\nrun_std_dev.m\n\nAlternatively, you could include your own code to do this, depending on what you need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes we need to overwrite multiple properties for one or more traces that have already been created e.g. in an include file. The global variables feature allows this, however, once this section becomes long with many trace property tweaks, it can become very hard to troubleshoot, and in these cases having all the information for one trace together is more desirable.\nInstead of using global variables you can duplicate the full trace ([Trace] ... [End]), and in your site-specific first stage INI file, put this duplicate after the line of code where the include file is called that contains your original trace. Note the additional Overwrite property highlighted in yellow:\n\nFigure 5.3C. Location within site-specific INI file to put duplicate trace for overwriting a trace previously defined in an include INI file. In this case, we want to overwrite the CH4_MIXING_RATIO trace that was originally defined in EddyPro_LI7700_FirstStage_include.ini. Yellow highlighting shows the syntax for the “overwrite” property.\nThere are three overwrite options:\n\n0 = do not overwrite with this trace. This is the default setting. If you do not include the Overwrite parameter, the pipeline assumes this option. If you have a duplicate trace, you will get an error during cleaning (Example 1):\n\n1 = overwrite traces having the same variableName and also with Overwrite = 0 setting. This puts the duplicate data where the original data was, i.e., complete overwrite, first trace gone. Use this setting if you want your duplicate T2 available to use in a later variable such as T3, T4, T5, etc. (Example 2):\n\n2 = overwrite traces having the same variableName and with Overwrite = 0 setting. This takes advantage of the “position” of the duplicate trace. Use this setting if you want a later variable such as T3 or T4 available to use in T2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore complex user-defined processing can be applied in the first stage to any trace using the very useful “Evaluate” and new “postEvaluate” options. Matlab functions (user-written or from Biomet.net) can be called from this statement. Multiple Matlab statements can be called from within the “Evaluate” or “postEvaluate” strings. They can be used to derive variables from available data, flag variables to remove bad data, or to calculate new useful variables. Here is an Evaluate example for removing outliers from a trace:\nEvaluate = 'wlen=24;thres=4;TA_1_1_1 = run_std_dev(TA_1_1_1,clean_tv,wlen,thres);'\nThe Evaluate property is executed for all traces before any other cleaning properties, e.g., minMax, calibration, etc.. In contrast, the newer postEvaluate property is executed in the first stage after all other cleaning is done.\nGenerally speaking, the order of operations is:\nEvaluate –&gt; other cleaning (e.g., minMax, calibration) –&gt; postEvaluate.\nThis is regardless of the order that they appear  within [Trace] ... [End]. The following series of examples shows how the Evaluate and postEvaluate statements work in relation to the other cleaning properties. For each example the input (Original) is an array of ones, and both the “Original” and first-stage “Clean” data are plotted in the result.\nExample 1: Only minMax and calibration, no Evaluate or postEvaluate statements\n\nResult: x = 2x [calibrated]\n\n\nExample 2: Evaluate, minMax and calibration, no postEvaluate statement\n\nResult: x = (x - 1)*2 [Evaluate first, then calibrate]\n\n\nExample 3: minMax and calibration, postEvaluate statement, no Evaluate statement\n\nResult: x = 2x - 1 [calibrate, then postEvaluate]\n\n\nExample 4: minMax and calibration, both Evaluate and postEvaluate statements\n\nResult: x = (x - 1)*2 - 1 [Evaluate, then calibrate, then postEvaluate]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOccasionally you might need to remove periods of data for certain instruments or a group of instruments, e.g., during calibration periods, times there was a known malfunction, etc. For this purpose, we can create flag files and traces, as follows:\n\nCreate one Excel file per year that includes the time period you need to remove, i.e., if you have erroneous data to remove from 2021 and 2022, make one file for each year(regardless of whether it is the same instrument/issue). The Excel file must follow the template shown in figure 5.3D (download template here), and the filename must also follow this pattern: SITEID1_Flags_YYYY.xlsx, where SITEID1 is your own site ID, and YYYY is the year (2022 in the example below).\n\nFigure 5.3D. Sample Excel flag file with two flags, flag_TA_1_1_1 and flag_RH_1_1_1, that will be removed for the corresponding time periods in column A.\nIn Matlab, run the following command, inputting the year (one year at a time), and siteID for the first two arguments, e.g.:\ndb_update_flags_files(2022, SITEID1, biomet_sites_default, biomet_database_default);\nContinuing with the example, a flag file called flag_TA_1_1_1 will be created for 2022 for the site with ID SITEID1. The flag trace is an array of zeros for all of 2022, except for the time period defined in the Excel file, where there are NaNs. In this flag file there will be NaNs from 18:30 on 14 April 2022 until 12:30 on 16 April 2022. The time stamp represents the end of the half-hourly period.\nNear the top of your INI file (so that it is easy to find), e.g., after global variables but before loading your main measurement traces, add a trace for this flag (see example in figure 5.3E).\n\nFigure 5.3E. Example flag trace to put in first stage INI file, with dependent TA_1_1_1.\nFill in the yellow highlighted text as follows:\n\nThe variableName and inputFileName should match the flag name in the Excel file you created;\nYou can specify the inputFileName_dates to tell the pipeline to only look for a flag in certain date range(s), i.e., the year(s) that the flag exists for;\nFor the dependent parameter, add in the variable that you wish the flag to act on.\n\nRun first stage cleaning: fr_automated_cleaning(yearIn,'SITEID',1) and check the output. This process will remove data for the time period defined in your Excel file for the dependent variable, since that time period has NaNs in the flag trace created in step 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create INI files starting from downloaded Ameriflux BASE and BIF data, see “Special Cases” in section 7; you will also find an example of how to do this with more generic cleaned data from other sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome programming rules that you must follow for the first and second stage INI files to be successfully read by the pipeline scripts:\n\n1.

    "text": "This section provides extensive details beyond the first-time set up in section 4, to help more advanced users. If you are creating INI files for the first time, we highly recommend following our quick-start tutorial: instructions for INI file creation begin in section 4.3.\nOn this page:\n\nWhat are INI files?\nGeneral outline for creating first stage INI file\nRunning first stage cleaning in Matlab\nProperties and parameters: first stage INI\nTags for dependent variables\nGlobal variables and include files\nOutlier detection\nOverwrite feature\nMore about Evaluate and postEvaluate: order of operations\nFlags for removing periods of data\nCreating INI files from Ameriflux data\nProgramming syntax rules for first and second stage INI files\nTips\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe INI files for a given flux site dictate how data is transferred from its raw format into a standardized, clean, and gap-filled format that can be used for scientific analysis. They provide instructions to a set of MATLAB and R scripts used to process data. Even though flux sites can be similar in set up, they are usually unique in some way (different sensors, loggers, record lengths, etc.), and the INI files provide a way to deal with these differences while standardizing the data across sites.\nThere are three files, one for each data cleaning stage. Before starting to create your own INI files, it is important that you complete all of section 2, read section 3, and complete sections 4.1 and 4.2 (which each have supplementary information in sections 5.1 and 5.2, respectively), so that you have the best chance of everything running smoothly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are doing this for the first time, you can obtain simplified template files from the quick-start instructions in section 4.3, and we recommend that you follow the tutorial in that section. These are the general steps to create your first stage INI (which usually requires the most work of the three stages):\n\nUsing your duplicated first stage INI file or downloaded template file, rename it using your unique measurement site ID. For example, the first stage INI file for a site with siteID = ‘DSM’ is named DSM_FirstStage.ini. This exact naming convention is important for the pipeline libraries to locate and use the file.\nEdit this first stage INI file, adding just a few variables at a time and test as you go (see subsection “Running first stage cleaning in Matlab” later on this page), before adding more variables. This will make troubleshooting much easier. The tutorial in section 4.3 gives step-by-step instructions for adding variables.\nDetails on INI file properties and parameters are listed in table 5.1 on this page.\nIn addition to the data cleaning principles previously outlined in section 3, keep in mind the following guidelines:\n\nSelect traces that are needed for future data analysis. Not all the measured variables from a site need to be here, only the ones that will be used in future analysis or those needed to improve cleaning, such as diagnostic variables.\nEach first stage trace name should follow Ameriflux guidelines including positional qualifiers where relevant. Filenames from your raw database can be renamed here.\nThe original values can be altered; calibrations can be applied; units can be changed.\nApply basic filtering: (a) values can be removed if they exceed minMax thresholds; (b) values can be clamped to the thresholds if they exceed clampedMinMax values.\nYou can create dependencies between different traces. If one trace has some data points removed, all its dependent traces will also have those data points removed.\nMore complex user-defined processing can be applied to the trace using the very useful “Evaluate” option (also available in second stage cleaning). Matlab functions (user-written or Biomet.net) can be called from this statement. Multiple Matlab statements can be called from within the “Evaluate” string. \n\nExample for air temperature trace: if you have an output variable from a Campbell Scientific data logger that represents your 2-m air temperature measurement named MET_HMP_T_2m_Avg, you would assign this variable name to the inputFileName parameter (figure 5.3A; yellow highlighted text). In this example, it would be renamed in this stage using the variableName parameter, as TA_1_1_1, following the Ameriflux naming convention.\n\nFigure 5.3A. Air temperature trace (TA_1_1_1) as defined in a first stage INI file, with input from MET_HMP_T_2m_Avg variable.\nOther fields that need editing are highlighted in peach:\n\nGive a descriptive title to your trace;\nInput the start date of measurements for this variable in matlab’s datenum format (YYYY,MM,DD);\nInput the source folder into measurementType (Met/Flux/other; these should match up with different measurement systems, i.e., Met for the Campbell Scientific data example, and Flux for EddyPro data);\nCheck the units;\nIf known, input the instrument model and serial number (SN);\nImportantly, choose minMax bounds that are appropriate for the climate of your site (values outside this range will become NaNs).\nFor details of all the parameters and their definitions, see the “Properties and parameters: first stage INI” subsection below.\n\nIf you have more than one air temperature measurement, you would create more traces to assign these, and use the Ameriflux naming convention to distinguish and define their relative positions (figure 5.3B). \n\nFigure 5.3B. Second air temperature trace (TA_1_2_1) defined in the same first stage INI file, in this case for a different vertical position (height of 350 cm), with input from MET_HMP_T_350cm_Avg variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have a few variables in your INI file, test it by running the fr_automated_cleaning.m function in Matlab (part of Biomet.net library), using the following command:\nfr_automated_cleaning_(yearIn,'SITEID',1)\nwhere the arguments are defined as follows:\nTable 5.3A. Argument definitions for fr_automated_cleaning function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nDescription\nType\n\n\n\n\nyearIn\nyear(s) you wish to clean data for\ninteger or integer array\n\n\nSITEID\nmeasurement site ID, e.g., ‘DSM’\nstring uppercase\n\n\ncleaning stage to run\n1 = first stage, 2 = second stage, 7 = third stage, 8 = convert to AmeriFlux CSV file\ninteger\n\n\n\nFor example, to run first stage cleaning for the DSM site for 2022, you would type: fr_automated_cleaning(2022,'DSM',1).\nWith this function, you can clean multiple years of data, e.g., 2020:2023, and once you have your INI files set up for later cleaning stages you can also run multiple stages e.g., [1 2 7]. Earlier stages must have been run at least once before running subsequent stages, so the appropriate data files exist as input for the next stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.3B. First stage INI file properties and parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nHeader/Comments\n“%” character indicates the beginning of a comment. Program will not process any characters that follow “%”. Use comments to add information and to better document the site. Each line of the INI file can be followed by a comment. Refer to the sample INI file for DSM site.\n\n\nSite_name\nName of the site. Any text can go here.\n\n\nSiteID\nThis is the name attributed to the site in the database (e.g., DSM). Must be uppercase.\n\n\nDifference_GMT_to_local_time\nTime difference between GMT time, that database is kept in, and the standard time at the site location. local_time+Difference_GMT_to_local_time -&gt; GMT time.\n\n\n[Trace]\nMarks the beginning of a new variable. The section has to end with the keyword [End].\n\n\nvariableName\nName of variable for first stage, following the Ameriflux naming convention. The variable with this name will show up in the subfolder “Clean” under the same folder where the original database file came from.\n\n\ntitle\nDescriptive variable name for plots/visualization.\n\n\ninputFileName\n{inputFileName} The name of the database file that contains data for this trace. The brackets are mandatory. The file name can include folder(s), e.g., 'Met/Tair', and the paths are relative to the main site path (./Database/yyyy/SITEID), so the above example translates into this filepath: './Database/yyyy/SITEID/Met/Tair'.Over the lifetime of a measurement site, the data logger programs can change and a sensor measurement that was assigned to a variable may change. To allow for different variable names over the site history the inputFileName can be given as: {'inputFileName1','inputFileName2'}. In this case, the parameter inputFileName_dates must be present and reflect this (see next parameter description). Advanced: if there is a need to load up a data file from an alternative site, the path can be constructed as follows: ../../SITEID2/dataFolder. This syntax ../../ moves the path pointer up two directory levels to /Database/yyyy and from there SITEID2/dataFolder takes the program to the correct folder.\n\n\ninputFileName_dates\n[datenum_start1 datenum_end1; datenum_start2 datenum_end2] The start and end dates of data periods for each of the inputFileNames, using the Matlab datenum function. If there are multiple inputFileNames per the example in the previous parameter description, e.g., {'inputFileName1','inputFileName2'} then the program needs to know the time periods when the data assigned to the variableName should come from inputFileName1, and when from inputFileName2. In that case, this field is mandatory. If the inputFileName parameter contains only one file name, this inputFileName_dates parameter is optional, but it is still a good practice to use it anyway for documentation purposes and in case other filenames are added in the future. The last datenum_end is usually set far into the future, e.g., datenum(2999,1,1).\n\n\nmeasurementType\nUsually 'Met' or 'Flux' (must be of Matlab type char). Mandatory parameter that sets the input and output trace folders. The input folder defaults to: SITEID/measurementType/inputFileName. If relative paths are used for the inputFileName parameter defined previously, the pipeline code “assumes” that the current folder is SITEID/measurementType, so the relative path is referenced to that. The output folder for the first stage cleaned trace is always SITEID/measurementType/Clean. Note: the measurementType must not be missing (empty), otherwise the data will be saved to SITEID/Clean/variableName which is incorrect and will cause errors in future cleaning stages.\n\n\nunits\nMeasurement units for this trace must be data type char. Important!\n\n\ninstrument\nThe name of the sensor that measures this trace, e.g., 'HMP155A'\n\n\ninstrumentSN\nSerial number of the sensor, if available.\n\n\nEvaluate\nOptional user-defined function. Examples: can be used to derive variables from available data; in flag variables to remove bad data; or for calculating new useful variables, e.g., Evaluate = 'TA_1_1_1 = shiftMyData(clean_tv,TA_1_1_1,datenum(2021,11,07,03,00,0),60);'. \n\n\npostEvaluate\nOptional user-defined function, intended for more complex cases. Same functionality as Evaluate property, but postEvaluate is executed after all the other Trace properties. \n\n\nloggedCalibration\nUsed together with currentCalibration (see next parameter). If you need to change the linear calibration for the trace, these coefficients are used to convert the trace values from engineering units to their original/raw units. Then the correct calibration coefficients (currentCalibration) are used. This can also be used to change the units. The format is [gain offset startDatenum endDatenum], where startDatenum and endDatenum refer to the time span that this particular set of coefficients should be applied. For example, with no change for data starting on 1 January 2020, the code would read loggedCalibration = [1 0 datenum(2020,1,1) datenum(2999,1,1)]. You can apply multiple calibrations to different time periods, separated by semicolons. Note: all calibration values need to be on the same line of code, i.e., no line-breaks are allowed in the INI file!\n\n\ncurrentCalibration\nCorrect(ed) linear calibration coefficients. Used together with loggedCalibrations (see notes for previous parameter for more details).\n\n\ncomments\nAny useful comments relating to this trace and its handling in the INI file, such as why certain flags are applied.\n\n\nminMax\n[min max] Minimum and maximum numerical thresholds for filtering. The values outside of this range will be set to NaN.\n\n\nclamped_minMax\n[cMin cMax] Similar to minMax but instead of setting the data points outside the range to NaN, it truncates their value to the cMin or cMax. (e.g., RH: [0 100]).Note: this parameter is not mandatory, however, when used, please make sure that the minMax property boundaries are wider than the boundaries of clamped_minMax because the minMax property is applied first. This parameter is useful for variables such as relative humidity, e.g., minMax = [-1 110] used with clamped_minMax=[0 100].\n\n\nzeroPt\nValue to indicate missing data. Many programs nowadays use -9999 to indicate bad/missing data points.\n\n\ndependent\nFilter-dependent variables based on specified trace. The current trace can have multiple dependents that need to be separated by commas, e.g., dependent = 'trace1','trace2','trace3'.For example, when using the LI-7200 pump, all the traces that depend on the LI-7200 are dependent on the pump trace. So, for the LI-7200: dependent = 'CO2','H2O'. Then the CO2 trace should have dependent = 'FC',... and so on. You can write these out manually where necessary or where this only occurs once or twice, but we highly recommend using the “tags” feature for common dependencies that are recurring.\n\n\n[End]\nMarks the end of the properties section for each trace.\n\n\n\n Note: Other properties that a user wants to use later on in their own programs (or in the “Evaluate” statements) can be added to each of the traces. The function that processes the INI files (read_ini_files.m) will add the property and its assigned value to the trace structure, but the rest of the Trace Analysis programs will ignore it. The user can then parse the trace info in their own programs (or within “Evaluate” statements) and take advantage of this feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned in the “dependent” parameter description in Table 5.1, you can use the tags feature to ensure that your INI file “catches” and filters all common dependent variables. This feature utilizes the Biomet library function tags_Standard.m. You should list the relevant tag in the “dependent” property field for it to work.\nFor example, given the standard tags, if you put 'tag_H2O_All' in the dependent field for a trace, all traces listed under that tag will then be dependents of that trace. Tags can refer to other tags. You can also create site-specific custom tags by creating a SITEID_CustomTags.m, making sure to follow the same format as the tags in tags_Standard.m. (This optional file should live in the Derived_Variables folder; see figure 4.7 in section 5.1 for the location).\nTags in your site-specific custom file will overwrite tags of the same name in the tags_Standard.m file, and Matlab will warn you that this is occurring (by beeping and writing out a message to the screen).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo simplify entering and editing the required parameters into the first stage INI file, there is an option to apply the same setting to many traces at once, using the “global variables” feature. At the top of the first stage INI template file (obtained in section 4.3), you will notice sections with headers containing “Global variables”. These are always defined at the beginning of the first stage INI file.\nThe main advantage of this feature is that it allows you to define a standard set of variables in templates called “include” files, which can be loaded into each site-specific INI file using the #include statement. We have provided samples of typical Met and EddyPro include files in the quick-start tutorial.\nAnother advantage is that you can apply changes to multiple traces all at once if needed, by making only one edit at the top of the file and then referencing this addition. This way, you do not risk missing multiple traces needing the same edit, so long as it is referenced correctly.\nNote: only the main body of your first stage INI file, not your “include” files, should contain global variables.\nThere are two types of global variables, as follows:\n\nInstrument-specific (globalVars.Instrument):\n\n\nFor the instrument-specific global variables, each trace has an instrumentType field. Currently we use five default instrument types (six if we consider an empty field [] as a type): LI7200, LI7700, Anemometer, EC, and otherTraces.\nExample:\nglobalVars.Instrument.LI7200.instrumentSN  = '72H-1029'\napplies this serial number to every trace which includes instrumentType = 'LI7200'.\nYou can also create your own unique sensor option for instrumentType, if you need to apply a setting to multiple traces.\notherTraces has been depreciated so if an existing INI file contains this code (e.g., from an old template file), you can either set it to zero or remove those lines of code altogether (otherTraces.Enable = 0). If this is set to 1, you will get warnings when you run cleaning.\n\n\nTrace-specific (globalVars.Trace):\n\n\nExample:\nglobalVars.Trace.CH4.currentCalibration \n                  = [1000 0 datenum(2021,1,1) datenum(2999,1,1)]\napplies this current calibration to the trace with variableName = 'CH4'.\nDetailed explanation: in the INI file, the trace “CH4” has the field currentCalibration set to empty: currentCalibration = []. There is a global variable for the same trace with the correct currentCalibration field:\nglobalVars.Trace.CH4.currentCalibration \n                  = [1000 0 datenum(2021,1,1) datenum(2999,1,1)]\nThe final result is that the field currentCalibration for the trace “CH4” gets set to: currentCalibration = [1000 0 datenum(2021,1,1) datenum(2999,1,1)].\n\n\nOther (globalVars.other):\n\n\nFor the third type of global variable, e.g., globalVars.other, currently you can use this to carry out single-point interpolation, for cases where just one half-hourly data point is missing:\nglobalVars.other.singlePointInterpolation = 'on'  % 'no_interp' - skip interpolation [default], 'on' - do single missing point interpolation for all traces\n\nAdding include files to your First Stage INI file\nIn sections 4.1 and 4.2, we introduced include files and how they are obtained. These template files define a standard set of variables that can be loaded into your first stage INI file. Specifically, the files relate to EddyPro output and radiation components. We suggest browsing through these files to become familiar with the content. If you wish to change or add any settings, we strongly recommend leaving the template “include” files untouched and using the global variables feature to create or overwrite the relevant setting, as previously described.\nMore information about include files:\n\nEddyPro_Common_FirstStage_include.ini: includes traces common to EddyPro output, listed in EddyPro file output order;\nEddyPro_LI7200_FirstStage_include.ini: when an LI-7200 IRGA is being used, this file adds LI-7200 specific traces, listed in EddyPro file output order;\nEddyPro_LI7500_FirstStage_include.ini: when an LI-7500 IRGA is being used, this file adds LI-7500 specific traces, listed in EddyPro file output order;\nEddyPro_LI7500_FirstStage_include.ini: when an LI-7500 IRGA is being used, this file adds LI-7500 specific traces, listed in EddyPro file output order;\nRAD_FirstStage_include.ini: includes radiation components.\n\nTo include any of these files, add the following line of code to the very bottom of your first stage INI file: #include &lt;relevant_file&gt;_include.ini. If you are using more than one, put them on multiple lines of code, still at the very bottom of the INI file, as follows:\n#include EddyPro_Common_FirstStage_include.ini\n#include EddyPro_LI7200_FirstStage_include.ini\n#include RAD_FirstStage_include.ini\nHow the global variables algorithm works:\n\nThe INI file trace parameters, i.e., all fields between [TRACE] and [END] in the INI file, are loaded up.\nThe program then cycles through all the traces: for each trace, first it checks if the instrumentType field matches one of the globalVars.Instrument fields, e.g., for instrumentType = 'LI7700' measuring “CH4”, if there is a global.Instrument.LI7700 field, then all its fields would be applied to the CH4 trace, either creating a new field or overwriting the existing fields; i.e., the content of global.Instrument.LI7700.instrumentSN would replace the content of the CH4 field instrumentSN. Secondly, it checks if the trace variableName matches any of the globalVars.Trace fields, e.g. Trace “CH4”.\nThe program continues reading the INI file and applies all the settings from the [TRACE]-[END] section.\nNext, it cycles through all the globalVars.Instrument fields and creates the fields or overwrites them if they already exist.\nFinally, it goes through all the globalVars.Trace fields and creates or overwrites the fields.\nThen the program moves to the next trace and repeats steps 2–5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs outlined earlier on this page, the Evaluate feature can be used to implement Matlab code. This can be useful for removing outliers from your data in the first stage. For example, in the Biomet library there are some existing functions to help with this, such as:\n\nremove_spikes_diurnal_nonParametric.m\nrun_std_dev.m\n\nAlternatively, you could include your own code to do this, depending on what you need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes we need to overwrite multiple properties for one or more traces that have already been created e.g. in an include file. The global variables feature allows this, however, once this section becomes long with many trace property tweaks, it can become very hard to troubleshoot, and in these cases having all the information for one trace together is more desirable.\nInstead of using global variables you can duplicate the full trace ([Trace] ... [End]), and in your site-specific first stage INI file, put this duplicate after the line of code where the include file is called that contains your original trace. Note the additional Overwrite property highlighted in yellow:\n\nFigure 5.3C. Location within site-specific INI file to put duplicate trace for overwriting a trace previously defined in an include INI file. In this case, we want to overwrite the CH4_MIXING_RATIO trace that was originally defined in EddyPro_LI7700_FirstStage_include.ini. Yellow highlighting shows the syntax for the “overwrite” property.\nThere are three overwrite options:\n\n0 = do not overwrite with this trace. This is the default setting. If you do not include the Overwrite parameter, the pipeline assumes this option. If you have a duplicate trace, you will get an error during cleaning (Example 1):\n\n1 = overwrite traces having the same variableName and also with Overwrite = 0 setting. This puts the duplicate data where the original data was, i.e., complete overwrite, first trace gone. Use this setting if you want your duplicate T2 available to use in a later variable such as T3, T4, T5, etc. (Example 2):\n\n2 = overwrite traces having the same variableName and with Overwrite = 0 setting. This takes advantage of the “position” of the duplicate trace. Use this setting if you want a later variable such as T3 or T4 available to use in T2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore complex user-defined processing can be applied in the first stage to any trace using the very useful “Evaluate” and new “postEvaluate” options. Matlab functions (user-written or from Biomet.net) can be called from this statement. Multiple Matlab statements can be called from within the “Evaluate” or “postEvaluate” strings. They can be used to derive variables from available data, flag variables to remove bad data, or to calculate new useful variables. Here is an Evaluate example for removing outliers from a trace:\nEvaluate = 'wlen=24;thres=4;TA_1_1_1 = run_std_dev(TA_1_1_1,clean_tv,wlen,thres);'\nThe Evaluate property is executed for all traces before any other cleaning properties, e.g., minMax, calibration, etc.. In contrast, the newer postEvaluate property is executed in the first stage after all other cleaning is done.\nGenerally speaking, the order of operations is:\nEvaluate –&gt; other cleaning (e.g., minMax, calibration) –&gt; postEvaluate.\nThis is regardless of the order that they appear  within [Trace] ... [End]. The following series of examples shows how the Evaluate and postEvaluate statements work in relation to the other cleaning properties. For each example the input (Original) is an array of ones, and both the “Original” and first-stage “Clean” data are plotted in the result.\nExample 1: Only minMax and calibration, no Evaluate or postEvaluate statements\n\nResult: x = 2x [calibrated]\n\n\nExample 2: Evaluate, minMax and calibration, no postEvaluate statement\n\nResult: x = (x - 1)*2 [Evaluate first, then calibrate]\n\n\nExample 3: minMax and calibration, postEvaluate statement, no Evaluate statement\n\nResult: x = 2x - 1 [calibrate, then postEvaluate]\n\n\nExample 4: minMax and calibration, both Evaluate and postEvaluate statements\n\nResult: x = (x - 1)*2 - 1 [Evaluate, then calibrate, then postEvaluate]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOccasionally you might need to remove periods of data for certain instruments or a group of instruments, e.g., during calibration periods, times there was a known malfunction, etc. For this purpose, we can create flag files and traces, as follows:\n\nCreate one Excel file per year that includes the time period you need to remove, i.e., if you have erroneous data to remove from 2021 and 2022, make one file for each year(regardless of whether it is the same instrument/issue). The Excel file must follow the template shown in figure 5.3D (download template here), and the filename must also follow this pattern: SITEID1_Flags_YYYY.xlsx, where SITEID1 is your own site ID, and YYYY is the year (2022 in the example below).\n\nFigure 5.3D. Sample Excel flag file with two flags, flag_TA_1_1_1 and flag_RH_1_1_1, that will be removed for the corresponding time periods in column A.\nIn Matlab, run the following command, inputting the year (one year at a time), and siteID for the first two arguments, e.g.:\ndb_update_flags_files(2022, SITEID1, biomet_sites_default, biomet_database_default);\nContinuing with the example, a flag file called flag_TA_1_1_1 will be created for 2022 for the site with ID SITEID1. The flag trace is an array of zeros for all of 2022, except for the time period defined in the Excel file, where there are NaNs. In this flag file there will be NaNs from 18:30 on 14 April 2022 until 12:30 on 16 April 2022. The time stamp represents the end of the half-hourly period.\nNear the top of your INI file (so that it is easy to find), e.g., after global variables but before loading your main measurement traces, add a trace for this flag (see example in figure 5.3E).\n\nFigure 5.3E. Example flag trace to put in first stage INI file, with dependent TA_1_1_1.\nFill in the yellow highlighted text as follows:\n\nThe variableName and inputFileName should match the flag name in the Excel file you created;\nYou can specify the inputFileName_dates to tell the pipeline to only look for a flag in certain date range(s), i.e., the year(s) that the flag exists for;\nFor the dependent parameter, add in the variable that you wish the flag to act on.\n\nRun first stage cleaning: fr_automated_cleaning(yearIn,'SITEID',1) and check the output. This process will remove data for the time period defined in your Excel file for the dependent variable, since that time period has NaNs in the flag trace created in step 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create INI files starting from downloaded Ameriflux BASE and BIF data, see “Special Cases” in section 7; you will also find an example of how to do this with more generic cleaned data from other sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome programming rules that you must follow for the first and second stage INI files to be successfully read by the pipeline scripts:\n\n1. We enforce using uppercase for site IDs to avoid problems with running data cleaning on Mac vs. Windows.\n2. All traces must be enclosed in [Trace] and [End] blocks.\n3. All assignments can be on multiple lines but should be enclosed in single quotes.\n4. Comments must begin with a percentage sign (%).\n5. All fields must be in Matlab format.\n6. All parameter assignments must be to strings in single quotes, or numeric expressions, e.g., threshold_const = 6, threshold_const = [6], variableName = 'Some Name'.\n7. For the first stage, the partial path must be included with the inputFileName when you locate the raw data trace in the database. (Using biomet_path function only returns the path: /year/SITEID/measType/)\n8. First stage necessary fields are: variableName, inputFileName, measurementType, units, title, and minMax.\n9. Second stage necessary fields are: variableName, title, units.\n\n\n\nTIPS\n\n\n\nOnce your INI file is complete, if desired you can use the simplify_FirstStageIni() function to clean it up. This may be helpful if you used a legacy INI file as an example; the function removes obsolete fields and makes things more concise.\n\n\nIf you are on a Linux operating system, make sure that you are using upper case for the measurementType parameter, everywhere it appears in your first stage INI, e.g., measurementType = 'Flux' or measurementType = 'Met'.",

This project directory must be on your local computer: avoid putting it on an external drive or cloud drive (like OneDrive or GDrive) as this will cause problems in the steps that follow. Additionally, avoid putting it in the Biomet.net directory.\nYou will also need to create a site ID that relates to the flux site you are working with. This is often an acronym based on the site name (e.g., Burns Bog has siteID = 'BB', Richmond Brackish Marsh has siteID = 'RBM'). Note that the siteID must be all upper case.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have multiple flux sites, choose one site to begin working with. Using the Matlab command line, define your projectPath and siteID as in the following example:\nFor example, if the name of your project is My_Micromet, and your chosen siteID is SITEID1, you would enter the following commands in the Matlab command window:\nMac example:\n projectPath = '/Users/&lt;username&gt;/Projects/My_Micromet/';\n siteID = 'SITEID1';\nPC example:\n projectPath = 'C:\\Projects\\My_Micromet\\';\n siteID = 'SITEID1';\nNext, in Matlab, run the create_TAB_ProjectFolders function (which is in the Biomet.net library that you cloned), as follows:\n create_TAB_ProjectFolders(projectPath,siteID)\nBoth input arguments are of type “string”. You can use single '' or double \"\" quotation marks for these purposes in Matlab, although technically, these mean slightly different things; see this link for more info.\nAs the function name suggests, this will create some folders on your computer and also transfer some necessary small files.

We can compare new variable y with x loaded in the previous example/code section.\nUse biomet_path again to define the filepath to the Second Stage clean data, e.g., pth = biomet_path(2022,'DSM','Clean/SecondStage')\n%% compare two traces\npth = biomet_path(2022,'DSM','Clean/SecondStage'); % load Second Stage clean NET radiation trace\ny = read_bor(fullfile(pth,'NETRAD_1_1_1'));     % no need to reload tv_dt, same data period is used\nplot(tv_dt,[x y])                               % compare clean vs original\nlegend('Measured','Cleaned')\ngrid on;zoom on\n\n\nExtract a data period:\n\n\nFor extracting a particular data period from your database, for closer inspection.\n%% extract a data period\nindPeriod = find(tv_dt&gt; \"May 1, 2022\" & tv_dt &lt;= \"Aug 1, 2022\");\nplot(tv_dt(indPeriod),[x(indPeriod) y(indPeriod)])  % compare clean vs original for May-Jul\nlegend('Measured','Cleaned')\ngrid on;zoom on\n\n\nLoad multiple years:\n\n\nSometimes it helps to look at multiple years together, this can help with spotting issues in different years, or if something is working in one year but not another, calibrations etc.\n%% Multiple years\nyearsIn = 2019:2022;                                    % loading multiple years in one go\npth = biomet_path('yyyy','BB','MET');                   % find data base path for multiple years, BB2 site\ntv = read_bor(fullfile(pth,'clean_tv'),8,[],yearsIn);   % load the time vector (Matlab's datenum format)\ntv_dt = datetime(tv,'convertfrom','datenum');           % convert to Matlab's datetime object (use for all new stuff)\nx = read_bor(fullfile(pth,'MET_HMP_T_2m_Avg'),[],[],yearsIn); % load MET_CNR4_Net_Avg trace from BB2/MET folder\nplot(tv_dt,x)                                           % plot data\ngrid on; zoom on;\n\n\nOther functions for visualizing data:\n\n\nplotApp and RShiny apps: see sections 6.1 and 6.2, respectively.\ngui_Browse_Folder: given a filepath, this function will open a new figure window and provide a dropdown containing all traces located at that filepath location. You can pick one or scroll through using the arrow buttons.\nguiPlotTraces: will open a simple GUI for browsing data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe R-script code shows how to load a set of variables from your database using the Biomet.net function read_database_generalized.R. You would need to edit the file path to Biomet and to your Database, and also the years, site ID, folder with relevant cleaning stage, and the list of variables you wish to load.\n# Load packages\nlibrary(lubridate) # work with dates\nlibrary(dplyr)     # data manipulation (filter, summarize, mutate)\nlibrary(openair) #For plotting wind and pollution roses (to explore the relationship between fluxes and wind direction)\nlibrary(ggsignif)\nlibrary(hms)\nlibrary(zoo)\nlibrary(here)\n\n# Load data from the database\np &lt;- sapply(list.files(pattern=\"read_database_generalized.R\", path=\"/Users/&lt;'username'&gt;/Code/Biomet.net/R/database_functions/\", full.names=TRUE), source)\n \n# Hogg site\ndb_path &lt;- '/Users/&lt;'username'&gt;/Code/local_data_cleaning/Database'\ndata.Hogg &lt;- read_data_generalized(db_path,c(2021:2023),\"HOGG\",\"Clean/ThirdStage\",c(\"NEE\",\"NEE_PI_F_MDS\",\"FCH4\",\"FCH4_PI_F_MDS\",\"FCH4_PI_F_RF\",\"H\",\"H_PI_F_MDS\",\"LE\",\"LE_PI_F_MDS\",\"GPP_PI_F_DT\",\"GPP_PI_F_NT\",\"Reco_PI_F_DT\",\"Reco_PI_F_NT\",\"NETRAD_1_1_1\",\"P_1_1_1\",\"PA_1_1_1\",\"RH_1_1_1\",\"SW_IN_1_1_1\",\"PPFD_IN_1_1_1\",\"TA_1_1_1\",\"TS_1\",\"TS_2\",\"TS_3\",\"USTAR\",\"VPD_1_1_1\",\"WD_1_1_1\",\"WS_1_1_1\"),\"clean_tv\",0)\n \ndata.Hogg$datetime &lt;- as.POSIXct(data.Hogg$datetime,\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%OS\",tz = 'UTC')\ndata.Hogg$DOY &lt;- yday(data.Hogg$datetime)",

    "text": "This section will show you how to start cleaning your data for the first stage. Note that the example assumes you have already created Flux and Met databases for the same site.\nOn this page:\n\nDownload INI/config template files\nInput site metadata\nInstructions to create first stage INI file\nTips\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following download provides templates for all stages of cleaning, so you will have the second and third stage INI/config files for later; this section only covers the first stage.\nTemplate and Sample INI/config files\n\nDownload the files above; unzip the contents, and copy the TEMPLATE files in the Template_INI_config_files folder to the location shown in figure 4.3A:\n\nFigure 4.3A. Directory tree showing location of template INI files inside relevant SITEID folder.\nRename the TEMPLATE files you just copied, replacing “TEMPLATE” with your site ID (SITEID1 in this example; this filename format is required).\nThe files in the Tutorial_filled_sample_files folder are completed, “filled-in” versions of the TEMPLATE files that work with the sample eddy-covariance and met data available for download in section 4.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen your site-specific SITEID1_config.yml file for editing.\nEnter your name, the date, and the metadata for your site (figure 4.3B; yellow highlighted text):\n\nsiteID: e.g., SITEID1;\nestYear: year that measurements at the site began;\nlatitude: North is positive;\nlongitude: West is negative;\nTimeZoneHour: timezone, e.g., for Pacific standard time, GMT - 8;\nnorthOffset: this can be found in your site GHG biomet file; this information is used for filtering data by wind direction, to comply with eddy-covariance measurement standards.\n\n\nFigure 4.3B. Site-specific custom YAML file (e.g., SITEID1_config.yml) showing which fields to edit in yellow highlighted text.\nSave and close this YAML file (you will come back to it later).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen your site-specific SITEID1_FirstStage.ini file for editing.\nNear the top of the file, insert the full name of your site (more descriptive is better), your site ID, and the timezone information. Difference_GMT_to_local_time is the timezone that your site is located in, and Timezone is the timezone that your data is stored in (UTC, standard time, or daylight saving time). Both these parameters are currently necessary in order to output the correct timezone for Ameriflux requirements (local standard time).\nNext, scroll down (skipping “Global Variables” sections for now) to where you see:\n %----------------------------------------------------\n %--&gt; Insert met variables here\n %----------------------------------------------------\nBeginning with air temperature, define the input data to each trace given in the INI file. For example, if you have an output variable that represents your 2-m air temperature measurement named MET_HMP_T_2m_Avg, you would assign this variable name to the inputFileName parameter (figure 4.3C; yellow highlighted text). During this first cleaning stage this trace will be renamed as TA_1_1_1 using the variableName parameter, following the Ameriflux naming convention.\n\nFigure 4.3C. Air temperature trace (TA_1_1_1) as defined in a first stage INI file, with input from MET_HMP_T_2m_Avg variable.\nOther fields that need editing are highlighted in peach:\n\nGive a descriptive title to your trace;\nInput the start date of measurements for this variable in matlab’s datenum format (YYYY,MM,DD);\nInput the source folder into measurementType (Met/Flux/other; these should match up with different measurement systems, i.e., Met for the Campbell Scientific data example, and Flux for EddyPro data);\nCheck the units;\nIf known, input the instrument model and serial number (SN);\nImportantly, choose minMax bounds that are appropriate for the climate of your site (values outside this range will become NaNs). \n\nOnce you have done this for a few variables, test the data cleaning in Matlab, using the fr_automated_cleaning.m function as follows:\n fr_automated_cleaning(yearIn,'SITEID',1)\nwhere yearIn is a numeric array containing the year(s) of data you want to clean (it is possible to clean multiple years at once but we will keep things simple with one year for now), SITEID would be SITEID1 from the earlier example, and ‘1’ represents the first stage of data cleaning.\nProvided everything worked with no errors, you should now see output data matching the variables you defined in a new Clean folder within your Met folder.\n\n\n\nIf you do NOT have a four-component net radiometer such as a CNR4 at your site, you can skip all of step 5 and go to step 6. If you do have a CNR4 or similar, we have provided an “include” INI file that loads relevant radiation variables for you. We strongly advise that you do not edit this or any other include file. Instead, scroll to the bottom of your site-specific INI file where the include files are called.\n\nUncomment* (e.g., delete %, NOT #) the line containing RAD_FirstStage_include.ini, so that the block of code looks like this:\n%----------------------------------------------------------\n% Call #include ini files\n%----------------------------------------------------------\n%--&gt; Must be at end of .ini file\n%--&gt; Comment out include files that are not needed\n%#include EddyPro_Common_FirstStage_include.ini\n%#include EddyPro_LI7200_FirstStage_include.ini\n%#include EddyPro_LI7500_FirstStage_include.ini\n%#include EddyPro_LI7700_FirstStage_include.ini\n#include RAD_FirstStage_include.ini\n*Recall that this file is read by Matlab, so comments are created using %; the # sign must be present to call the include file.\nNext, scroll almost to the top of the file where you see:\n%----------------------------------------------------------\n% Global variable specification (trace-specific)\n%----------------------------------------------------------\n%--&gt; Radiation sensor information: \n%--&gt; If using CNR4 with RAD_FirstStage_include file, add inputFileNames etc., for example:\n%globalVars.Trace.SW_IN_1_1_1.inputFileName     = {'MET_CNR4_SWi_Avg'}\n\nglobalVars.Trace.SW_IN_1_1_1.inputFileName              = {''}\nglobalVars.Trace.SW_IN_1_1_1.inputFileName_dates        = [datenum(1900,1,1) datenum(2999,12,31)]\nglobalVars.Trace.SW_IN_1_1_1.instrument                 = 'CNR4'\nglobalVars.Trace.SW_IN_1_1_1.instrumentSN               = ''\nFor SW_IN_1_1_1 (incoming shortwave radiation), add:\n\nThe inputFileName from your database;\nEdit the start date for your data record in inputFileName_dates;\nEdit instrument (if necessary); and\nAdd the serial number (instrumentSN).\n\nAll these parameters are used for the other radiation variables defined below this one, apart from inputFileName, which you will need to input for each variable. Also, if you have a PAR radiometer, you can use the PPFD global variables in this radiation section in the same way.\nRun fr_automated_cleaning(yearIn,'SITEID',1) again to test this change. This step will add the radiation variables into the same Met folder as in step 4.\n\nNext, we will clean your Flux variables. As previously mentioned, if you followed step 5, we have provided “include” files that load most information on common traces for you.\n\nTo use these files, scroll to the bottom of your first stage INI file. For anyone with EddyPro output, you need to use EddyPro_Common_FirstStage_include.ini, which contains all variables common to all IRGAs. Then, also uncomment the other line(s) for your specific IRGA(s).\nFor example, let’s assume you are using a LiCor LI-7200 and LI-7700 at your site. Then you would uncomment the relevant include files, as follows:\n%----------------------------------------------------------\n% Call #include ini files\n%----------------------------------------------------------\n%--&gt; Must be at end of .ini file\n%--&gt; Comment out include files that are not needed\n#include EddyPro_Common_FirstStage_include.ini\n#include EddyPro_LI7200_FirstStage_include.ini\n%#include EddyPro_LI7500_FirstStage_include.ini\n#include EddyPro_LI7700_FirstStage_include.ini\n%#include RAD_FirstStage_include.ini\nNow scroll up to:\n%---------------------------------------\n% Global variables (instrument-specific)\n%---------------------------------------\n% The instrument traces will all need to have the same\n% instrumentType field 'LI7200', 'LI7700'...\n% and come from the same software (EddyPro)\n\n% If using LI7200 with EddyPro_LI7200_FirstStage_include file:\nglobalVars.Instrument.IRGA.Enable                       = 1     % Required variable 0/1\nglobalVars.Instrument.IRGA.instrument                   = 'LI-7200' % Edit if using LI7500\nglobalVars.Instrument.IRGA.instrumentSN                 = ''    \nglobalVars.Instrument.IRGA.inputFileName_dates          = [datenum(1900,1,1) datenum(2999,12,31)]\nEnter/edit the relevant parameter details for your IRGA(s) (instrument, serial number, start date of measurements). Do the same for your anemometer and full eddy-covariance (EC) system instruments (e.g., CSAT3 plus IRGA). ‘otherTraces’ includes all instrument types not previously defined within global variables, and must be enabled, with measurement record dates defined.\nRun fr_automated_cleaning(yearIn,'SITEID',1) again to test this addition. You should see your first-stage cleaned data appear in a new Clean folder within your Flux folder.\n\nAt this stage, you can start to add any Met or Flux variables that may not already be included in the template files. You can do this by copy-pasting the [Trace]...[End] code block (like the one in figure 4.3C) and editing the parameter inputs accordingly.\nAlso, for example, if you have more than one air temperature measurement, you would create more traces to assign these and use the Ameriflux naming convention to distinguish and define their relative positions (figure 4.3D).\n\nFigure 4.3D. Second air temperature trace (TA_1_2_1) defined in the same first stage INI file, in this case for a different vertical position (height of 350 cm), with input from MET_HMP_T_350cm_Avg variable.\n\n\n\n\n\nTips\n\n\nPay attention to the output display; it is informative.\n\n\nDo not directly edit any of the “include” files that we provided. Instead, if needed, follow the instructions on how to override any settings in those files.\n\n\nWe recommend using the “quick-look” visualization tools at any stage of cleaning to check that your data looks as expected (e.g., the filenames are correct and the retained values conform to your minMax bounds).\n\n\nSee section 5.3 for lots more guidance and information on first stage INI files. For cases where you do not have input data for all traces defined in any include file that you use, see “Special Cases” in section 7 on troubleshooting.",

Air temperature trace (TA_1_1_1) as defined in a first stage INI file, with input from MET_HMP_T_2m_Avg variable.\nOther fields that need editing are highlighted in peach:\n\nGive a descriptive title to your trace;\nInput the start date of measurements for this variable in matlab’s datenum format (YYYY,MM,DD);\nInput the source folder into measurementType (Met/Flux/other; these should match up with different measurement systems, i.e., Met for the Campbell Scientific data example, and Flux for EddyPro data);\nCheck the units;\nIf known, input the instrument model and serial number (SN);\nImportantly, choose minMax bounds that are appropriate for the climate of your site (values outside this range will become NaNs). \n\nOnce you have done this for a few variables, test the data cleaning in Matlab, using the fr_automated_cleaning.m function as follows:\n fr_automated_cleaning(yearIn,'SITEID',1)\nwhere yearIn is a numeric array containing the year(s) of data you want to clean (it is possible to clean multiple years at once but we will keep things simple with one year for now), SITEID would be SITEID1 from the earlier example, and ‘1’ represents the first stage of data cleaning.\nProvided everything worked with no errors, you should now see output data matching the variables you defined in a new Clean folder within your Met folder.\n\n\n\nIf you do NOT have a four-component net radiometer such as a CNR4 at your site, you can skip all of step 5 and go to step 6. If you do have a CNR4 or similar, we have provided an “include” INI file that loads relevant radiation variables for you. We strongly advise that you do not edit this or any other include file. Instead, scroll to the bottom of your site-specific INI file where the include files are called.\n\nUncomment* (e.g., delete %, NOT #) the line containing RAD_FirstStage_include.ini, so that the block of code looks like this:\n%----------------------------------------------------------\n% Call #include ini files\n%----------------------------------------------------------\n%--&gt; Must be at end of .ini file\n%--&gt; Comment out include files that are not needed\n%#include EddyPro_Common_FirstStage_include.ini\n%#include EddyPro_LI7200_FirstStage_include.ini\n%#include EddyPro_LI7500_FirstStage_include.ini\n%#include EddyPro_LI7700_FirstStage_include.ini\n#include RAD_FirstStage_include.ini\n*Recall that this file is read by Matlab, so comments are created using %; the # sign must be present to call the include file.\nNext, scroll almost to the top of the file where you see:\n%----------------------------------------------------------\n% Global variable specification (trace-specific)\n%----------------------------------------------------------\n%--&gt; Radiation sensor information: \n%--&gt; If using CNR4 with RAD_FirstStage_include file, add inputFileNames etc., for example:\n%globalVars.Trace.SW_IN_1_1_1.inputFileName     = {'MET_CNR4_SWi_Avg'}\n\nglobalVars.Trace.SW_IN_1_1_1.inputFileName              = {''}\nglobalVars.Trace.SW_IN_1_1_1.inputFileName_dates        = [datenum(1900,1,1) datenum(2999,12,31)]\nglobalVars.Trace.SW_IN_1_1_1.instrument                 = 'CNR4'\nglobalVars.Trace.SW_IN_1_1_1.instrumentSN               = ''\nFor SW_IN_1_1_1 (incoming shortwave radiation), add:\n\nThe inputFileName from your database;\nEdit the start date for your data record in inputFileName_dates;\nEdit instrument (if necessary); and\nAdd the serial number (instrumentSN).\n\nAll these parameters are used for the other radiation variables defined below this one, apart from inputFileName, which you will need to input for each variable. Also, if you have a PAR radiometer, you can use the PPFD global variables in this radiation section in the same way.\nRun fr_automated_cleaning(yearIn,'SITEID',1) again to test this change. This step will add the radiation variables into the same Met folder as in step 4.\n\nNext, we will clean your Flux variables. As previously mentioned, if you followed step 5, we have provided “include” files that load most information on common traces for you.\n\nTo use these files, scroll to the bottom of your first stage INI file. For anyone with EddyPro output, you need to use EddyPro_Common_FirstStage_include.ini, which contains all variables common to all IRGAs. Then, also uncomment the other line(s) for your specific IRGA(s).\nFor example, let’s assume you are using a LiCor LI-7200 and LI-7700 at your site. Then you would uncomment the relevant include files, as follows:\n%----------------------------------------------------------\n% Call #include ini files\n%----------------------------------------------------------\n%--&gt; Must be at end of .ini file\n%--&gt; Comment out include files that are not needed\n#include EddyPro_Common_FirstStage_include.ini\n#include EddyPro_LI7200_FirstStage_include.ini\n%#include EddyPro_LI7500_FirstStage_include.ini\n#include EddyPro_LI7700_FirstStage_include.ini\n%#include RAD_FirstStage_include.ini\nNow scroll up to:\n%---------------------------------------\n% Global variables (instrument-specific)\n%---------------------------------------\n% The instrument traces will all need to have the same\n% instrumentType field 'LI7200', 'LI7700'...\n% and come from the same software (EddyPro)\n\n% If using LI7200 with EddyPro_LI7200_FirstStage_include file:\nglobalVars.Instrument.IRGA.Enable                       = 1     % Required variable 0/1\nglobalVars.Instrument.IRGA.instrument                   = 'LI-7200' % Edit if using LI7500\nglobalVars.Instrument.IRGA.instrumentSN                 = ''    \nglobalVars.Instrument.IRGA.inputFileName_dates          = [datenum(1900,1,1) datenum(2999,12,31)]\nEnter/edit the relevant parameter details for your IRGA(s) (instrument, serial number, start date of measurements). Do the same for your anemometer and full eddy-covariance (EC) system instruments (e.g., CSAT3 plus IRGA). ‘otherTraces’ includes all instrument types not previously defined within global variables, and must be enabled, with measurement record dates defined.\nRun fr_automated_cleaning(yearIn,'SITEID',1) again to test this addition. You should see your first-stage cleaned data appear in a new Clean folder within your Flux folder.\n\nAt this stage, you can start to add any Met or Flux variables that may not already be included in the template files. You can do this by copy-pasting the [Trace]...[End] code block (like the one in figure 4.3C) and editing the parameter inputs accordingly.\nAlso, for example, if you have more than one air temperature measurement, you would create more traces to assign these and use the Ameriflux naming convention to distinguish and define their relative positions (figure 4.3D).\n\nFigure 4.3D. Second air temperature trace (TA_1_2_1) defined in the same first stage INI file, in this case for a different vertical position (height of 350 cm), with input from MET_HMP_T_350cm_Avg variable.\n\n\n\n\n\nTips\n\n\nPay attention to the output display; it is informative.\n\n\nDo not directly edit any of the “include” files that we provided. Instead, if needed, follow the instructions on how to override any settings in those files.\n\n\nWe recommend using the “quick-look” visualization tools at any stage of cleaning to check that your data looks as expected (e.g., the filenames are correct and the retained values conform to your minMax bounds).\n\n\nSee section 5.3 for lots more guidance and information on first stage INI files. For cases where you do not have input data for all traces defined in any include file that you use, see “Special Cases” in section 7 on troubleshooting.",

Chart outlining the data cleaning principles followed in the pipeline.\n\n\n\nPrinciple: During the first stage of data cleaning, we want to keep the best measured data values from each sensor, i.e., a user looking for the best measurements from a particular sensor would want to use the first stage data. Missing data points for periods of more than one half-hour will not be gap-filled in any way. \nAt the most basic level, the first stage collects the raw data, applies min/max filtering, assigns consistent variable names in line with Ameriflux guidelines as far as possible, and moves the relevant files to a Clean folder in preparation for stage two. This folder will be created automatically if it does not already exist.\nThe data are stored as binary files in “single-precision floating-point format” (aka float 32), which importantly means they are readable in most common computer languages and software.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciple: The second stage focuses on creating the best measured data values for each particular property/variable. For example, if there are two (or more) collocated temperature sensors at the same height e.g., 2 metres above ground level, the second stage is intended to create the “best” trace using both (all) sensors, with the highest precision/accuracy and the fewest missing points. By default, it does this by averaging the traces, and gap-filling by using linear regression. Optionally, data can be gap-filled using a nearby climate station, or one of your own nearby stations if you have one. (Other gap-filling methods, such as using reanalysis data, are currently under development.)\nIn practice, the second stage collects the first stage data, generates the “best” observation for each variable and moves the relevant files to a “Clean/SecondStage” folder in preparation for the third stage.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciple: USTAR filtering, gap-filling, and CO2 flux partitioning.\nThe third stage collects the second stage data and implements USTAR filtering, gap-filling, and flux partitioning procedures. For this we use the R package REddyProc. Biomet.net functions allow Matlab to interface with R, so all three stages are run directly from Matlab. For more machine learning approaches to gap-filling, we also implement the random forest approach described in the paper by Kim et al. (2020). Additional methane gap-filling processes currently not part of the pipeline are described here, with instructions here.\n\nWe achieve these principles by setting up various configuration files used in each stage. This process is described later (section 4.3), but there are a few more steps to complete before that. Next, you will set up your project directory structure and then configure it to work with the Biomet.net library.",

(Other gap-filling methods, such as using reanalysis data, are currently under development.)\nIn practice, the second stage collects the first stage data, generates the “best” observation for each variable and moves the relevant files to a “Clean/SecondStage” folder in preparation for the third stage.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciple: USTAR filtering, gap-filling, and CO2 flux partitioning.\nThe third stage collects the second stage data and implements USTAR filtering, gap-filling, and flux partitioning procedures. For this we use the R package REddyProc. Biomet.net functions allow Matlab to interface with R, so all three stages are run directly from Matlab. For more machine learning approaches to gap-filling, we also implement the random forest approach described in the paper by Kim et al. (2020). Additional methane gap-filling processes currently not part of the pipeline are described here, with instructions here.\n\nWe achieve these principles by setting up various configuration files used in each stage. This process is described later (section 4.3), but there are a few more steps to complete before that. Next, you will set up your project directory structure and then configure it to work with the Biomet.net library.",
