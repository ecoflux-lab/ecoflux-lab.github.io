I am a geographer, researcher, and educator who has been living as an uninvited guest on unceded Coast Salish Territory since 2015. I received a PhD in geography from UBC in 2022 and am now working as a postdoctoral researcher for the UBC Micrometeorology group. I study greenhouse gas exchange in wetland ecosystems and associated feedback mechanisms that influence the earth’s climate system. My research employs a variety of methods from different fields, including: micrometeorology, remote sensing, spatial analysis, and machine learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nDr. Joyson Ahongshangbam\n\n\nPosition\nPostdoctoral Scholar\n\n\nEmail\njoyson.ahongshangbam@mcgill.ca\n\n\nOrcid\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0002-2678-6879\n\n\n\n\n\nI am interested in studying the carbon and water cycle in different ecosystems (forest, urban vegetation and wetlands) using observations such as eddy covariance, sap flow and remote sensing techniques. My research includes understanding the responses of carbon and water dynamics with the land cover change, management activities and climate change (drought and heatwave).\n\nPrevious experience\n\nUniversity of Helsinki, Finland, Postdoctoral researcher\n\nEducation\n\nUniversity of Göttingen, Germany, PhD\n\n\nIndian Institute of Remote sensing, India, Masters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nTzu-Yi Lu\n\n\nLevel of Study\nPh.D. Candidate\n\n\n\n\n\nI received my MS in Geography from National Taiwan University in 2017. I am interested in understanding the response of the wetland ecosystem to climate change, especially in quantifying the net exchange of carbon. My previous research investigated the relationship between environmental controls and CO2 flux in low-latitude wetland ecosystems, applying an Artificial Neural Network technique to simulate the variance of carbon exchange by meteorological variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nKatrina Poppe\n\n\nPronouns\nShe/Her/Hers\n\n\nLevel of Study\nPh.D. Candidate\n\n\nEmail\npoppek@student.ubc.ca\n\n\n\n\n\nI earned an MS in Environmental Science from Western Washington University in 2016 and continued at WWU as a Research Associate for several years. My previous research has focused primarily on blue carbon, studying soil carbon sequestration rates in Pacific Northwest estuaries and in United Arab Emirates mangroves, in addition to monitoring and modeling vegetation and sediment dynamics in relation to estuary restoration and sea level rise. I am currently interested in studying greenhouse gas fluxes in Pacific Northwest tidal wetlands – particularly how they respond to ecosystem restoration and climate change – to ultimately better understand the value of tidal wetland management actions as natural climate solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nSarah Russell\n\n\nLevel of Study\nPh.D. Student\n\n\n\n\n\nI received a BS in Biological Sciences from Wellesley College in 2017, then worked as an ecosystem ecology field technician and research assistant before moving to Vancouver. I am interested in land-atmosphere carbon dynamics and am particularly interested in quantifying the terrestrial carbon sink. My research at UBC involves modeling greenhouse gas fluxes from restored tidal wetlands in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nTed Scott\n\n\nPronouns\nHe/Him/His\n\n\nLevel of Study\nPh.D. Student\n\n\nEmail\ntedjs@student.ubc.ca\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior to UBC, while at the University of Minnesota, I earned a BS in Computer Science (1997), then a MS (2000) and PhD in Geophysics (2006) under David Kohlstedt, investigating the dynamic properties of partially molten peridotites. My work helped constrain the composition and behavior of highly molten planetary interiors such as Jupiter’s moon Io. I then worked at Microsoft for several years as a data scientist and engineer, and more recently as a high-school science and math teacher. My current research interests include studying greenhouse gas fluxes in wetland environments. I then synthesize the data collected across multiple sites in various environments to better understand how individually and collectively they can contribute as a natural climate solution. As in my prior PhD, I hope my work can be used to better constrain climate models and lead to sound policy as we address climate change. In my free time, I enjoy trail running and rock climbing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nHehan (Zoe) Zhang\n\n\nPronouns\nShe/Her/Hers\n\n\nLevel of Study\nM.Sc. Student\n\n\nEmail\nhehanzha@student.ubc.ca\n\n\n\n\n\nI received a BSc in Environmental Science from the University of British Columbia in 2022. My undergraduate thesis research investigated the impacts of fire on greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes (CO2, CH4, and N2O) within different burned zones of a bog. The methodology incorporated chamber measurements and gas chromatography for the analysis. Currently, as a second-year MSc student, I am examining the impacts of seedling removal — a post-fire management practice — on the GHG fluxes (CO2 and CH4) within the 2016 burned zone of the Burns Bog, Delta, BC. This research utilizes a smart chamber with a portable analyzer. Additionally, I am interested in quantifying the net carbon exchange at the ecosystem scale using eddy covariance techniques and understanding carbon dynamics across varying ecosystem types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nVanessa Valenti\n\n\nLevel of Study\nM.Sc. Student\n\n\n\n\n\nI earned a Bachelor’s degree in Geography/Environmental Studies from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2019. Before coming to UBC, I worked as a scientific programmer at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, providing visualization and computation support to earth system and atmosphere climate models. I am interested in modelling land-atmosphere exchanges and projecting responses of wetland and forested ecosystems to climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nKelsey McGuire\n\n\nPronouns\nShe/Her/Hers\n\n\nLevel of Study\nB.Sc. Student\n\n\nEmail\nkmcgu@student.ubc.ca\n\n\n\n\n\nI am currently doing a B.Sc in Geographical Sciences, with concentrations in Climatology and Geographic Information Systems. Within the lab, I am supporting various graduate students with their research on how wetland and tidal sites can act as natural climate solutions, where I will help to write code for data processing, and assist on field site visits. I hope in later years to conduct more research on land-atmosphere exchanges, specifically around the carbon cycle, and find ways to incorporate different GIS technologies to help in visualizing it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nHimari Honda\n\n\nPronouns\nShe/Her/Hers\n\n\nLevel of Study\nB.Sc. Student\n\n\nEmail\nhhonda02@student.ubc.ca\n\n\n\n\n\nI am an undergraduate student at UBC majoring in Geographical Sciences with a concentration in climatology. My work in the lab consists of facilitating graduate students with their research and field visits to the flux towers. I am currently working with Zoe Zhang to pursue further research on the effects of heatwaves on carbon dioxide and methane fluxes at restored peatlands. In the near future, I am interested in studying how greenhouse gas exchange is influenced by varying biophysical and meteorological factors.",

Note that the example assumes you have already created Flux and Met databases for the same site.\n\n\n\n\nOpen your site-specific SITEID1_FirstStage.ini file for editing.\nNear the top of the file, insert the full name of your site (more descriptive is better), your site ID, and the timezone information. Difference_GMT_to_local_time is the timezone that your site is located in, and Timezone is the timezone that your data is reported in (UTC, standard time, or daylight saving time).

For example, if you have an output variable that represents your 2-m air temperature measurement named MET_HMP_T_2m_Avg, you would assign this variable name to the inputFileName parameter (figure 6.2; yellow highlighted text). During this first cleaning stage this trace will be renamed as TA_1_1_1 using the variableName parameter, following the Ameriflux naming convention.\n\nFigure 6.2.

If you do have a CNR4 or similar, we have provided an “include” INI file that loads relevant radiation variables for you. We strongly advise that you do not edit this or any other include file. Instead, scroll to the bottom of your site-specific INI file where the include files are called.\n\nUncomment* (e.g., delete % - NOT #) the line containing RAD_FirstStage_include.ini, so that the block of code looks like this:\n%----------------------------------------------------------\n% Call #include ini files\n%----------------------------------------------------------\n%--&gt; Must be at end of .ini file\n%--&gt; Comment out include files that are not needed\n%#include EddyPro_Common_FirstStage_include.ini\n%#include EddyPro_LI7200_FirstStage_include.ini\n%#include EddyPro_LI7500_FirstStage_include.ini\n%#include EddyPro_LI7700_FirstStage_include.ini\n#include RAD_FirstStage_include.ini\n*Recall that this file is read by Matlab, so comments are created using %; the # sign must be present to call the include file.\nNext, scroll almost to the top of the file where you see:\n%----------------------------------------------------------\n% Global variable specification (trace-specific)\n%----------------------------------------------------------\n%--&gt; Radiation sensor information: \n%--&gt; If using CNR4 with RAD_FirstStage_include file, add inputFileNames etc., for example:\n%globalVars.Trace.SW_IN_1_1_1.inputFileName     = {'MET_CNR4_SWi_Avg'}\n\nglobalVars.Trace.SW_IN_1_1_1.inputFileName              = {''}\nglobalVars.Trace.SW_IN_1_1_1.inputFileName_dates        = [datenum(1900,1,1) datenum(2999,12,31)]\nglobalVars.Trace.SW_IN_1_1_1.instrument                 = 'CNR4'\nglobalVars.Trace.SW_IN_1_1_1.instrumentSN               = ''\nFor SW_IN_1_1_1 (incoming shortwave radiation), add:\n\nThe inputFileName from your database;\nEdit the start date for your data record in inputFileName_dates;\nEdit instrument (if necessary); and\nAdd the serial number (instrumentSN).\n\nAll these parameters are used for the other radiation variables defined below this one, apart from inputFileName, which you will need to input for each variable. Also, if you have a PAR radiometer you can use the PPFD global variables in this radiation section in the same way.\nRun fr_automated_cleaning(yearIn,'SITEID',1) again to test this change. This step will add the radiation variables into the same Met folder as in step 4.\n\nNext, we will clean your Flux variables. As previously mentioned if you followed step 5, we have provided “include” files that load most information on common traces for you.\n\nTo use these files scroll to the bottom of your first stage INI file. For anyone with EddyPro output, you need to use EddyPro_Common_FirstStage_include.ini, which contains all variables common to all IRGAs; then, also uncomment the other line(s) for your specific IRGA(s).\nFor example, let’s assume you are using a LiCor LI-7200 and LI-7700 at your site. Then you would uncomment the relevant include files, as follows:\n%----------------------------------------------------------\n% Call #include ini files\n%----------------------------------------------------------\n%--&gt; Must be at end of .ini file\n%--&gt; Comment out include files that are not needed\n#include EddyPro_Common_FirstStage_include.ini\n#include EddyPro_LI7200_FirstStage_include.ini\n%#include EddyPro_LI7500_FirstStage_include.ini\n#include EddyPro_LI7700_FirstStage_include.ini\n%#include RAD_FirstStage_include.ini\nNow scroll up to:\n%---------------------------------------\n% Global variables (instrument-specific)\n%---------------------------------------\nEnter/edit the relevant parameter details for your IRGA(s) (instrument, serial number, start date of measurements). Do the same for your anemometer and full eddy-covariance (EC) system instruments (e.g., CSAT3 plus IRGA). ‘otherTraces’ includes all instrument types not previously defined within global variables, and must be enabled, with measurement record dates defined.\nRun fr_automated_cleaning(yearIn,'SITEID',1) again to test this addition. You should see your first-stage cleaned data appear in a new Clean folder within your Flux folder.\n\nAt this stage, you can start to add any Met or Flux variables that may not already be included in the template files. Also, for example, if you have more than one air temperature measurement, you would create more traces to assign these, and use the Ameriflux naming convention to distinguish and define their relative positions (figure 6.3).\n\nFigure 6.3. Second air temperature trace defined in the same first stage INI file, in this case for a different vertical position (height of 350 cm), with input from MET_HMP_T_350cm_Avg variable.\n\nTIPS\n\n\nPay attention to the output display, it is informative.\n\n\nWe recommend using the “quick-look” visualization tools at any stage of cleaning to check your data looks as expected (e.g., the filenames are correct and the values conform to your minMax bounds).",

Second air temperature trace defined in the same first stage INI file, in this case for a different vertical position (height of 350 cm), with input from MET_HMP_T_350cm_Avg variable.\n\nTIPS\n\n\nPay attention to the output display, it is informative.\n\n\nWe recommend using the “quick-look” visualization tools at any stage of cleaning to check your data looks as expected (e.g., the filenames are correct and the values conform to your minMax bounds).",

    "text": "The integrated GHG Research and Observations in Wetlands (iGROW) Research Program\nAmong the numerous ecosystem services provided by wetlands climate regulation is identified as one of their most important benefits to society. Wetland ecosystems play an important role in the global carbon cycle; they provide the ideal environment for long-term storage of atmospheric carbon dioxide, yet they are also the largest single source of methane. Climate change has the potential to increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from wetlands, however, the consequences of rising temperatures on wetland GHG exchange remains uncertain. Furthermore, preventing further wetland loss and restoring wetland ecosystems has been identified by researchers and governments as important in limiting future emissions to help meet climate goals. The integrated GHG Research and Observations in Wetlands (iGROW) research program’, takes an interdisciplinary approach to provide a better understanding of how wetland responses to climate variability and restoration can feedback to slow or accelerate future climate change. iGROW combines state-of-the-art field-based measurements, remote sensing, and modelling to provide new insights into the controls of wetland GHG fluxes across a range of spatial and temporal scales and quantify the potential climate benefits of wetland restoration and conservation. This research is key to better predicting current and future contributions of wetlands to climate change, which is highly relevant for policies aiming to limit the level of global temperature rise. Current iGROW research projects include:\n\nCarbon Fluxes in Restored Wetlands\n\nIn collaboration with several other research groups at UBC, my lab’s research is focused on measuring GHG, water, and energy fluxes over Burns Bog, a restored peatland in Metro Vancouver. This site is a raised domed peat bog that is undergoing re-wetting as a restoration management strategy following peat harvesting and associated drainage. While restoration can help recover important ecosystems services provided by wetlands, it can also affect the exchange of greenhouse gases, water and energy between the surface and the atmosphere.\n\nBy conducting year-round eddy covariance measurements, we are assessing the biogeochemical and biophysical impacts of peatland restoration, and the impacts of forest fire smoke on carbon cycling and energy fluxes in restored peatlands. This research is also being done in collaboration with researchers and staff at Metro Vancouver who are interested in quantifying the climate mitigation potential of wetland restoration and conservation. \nCollaborators:  UBC Ecohydrology Research Group  UBC Biometeorology and Soil Physics Group  Dan Moore’s Research Group, UBC Geography \nNews on Burns Bog:  April 20, 2023 - Up in smoke: Human activities are fuelling wildfires that burn essential carbon-sequestering peatlands  June 16, 2021 - David Suzuki: For climate’s sake, save the peat!  June 29, 2020 - Carbon Neutral Achievement Sets Stage for Bold Climate Action \n\n\nBlue Carbon Research\n\nBlue carbon is the carbon sequestered and stored in coastal ecosystems including tidal marshes, mangroves, and seagrasses. Coastal ecosystems are among the strongest carbon sinks in the biosphere. This coupled with their potential for low methane emissions, has generated widespread interest in these ecosystems for climate change mitigation and adaptation. However, measuring and modelling carbon exchanges in tidal wetlands presents unique challenges due to highly dynamic atmospheric and hydrological fluxes, as well as sensitivities to both terrestrial and marine influences. Through iGROW, my research group recently installed two eddy covariance flux towers (CA-DSM and CA-RBM) in tidal wetlands along the Pacific Coast of Canada to quantify and model the net carbon and GHG balance of these marshes, which represent an important data gap in ecosystem-scale measurements of GHG exchange from tidal marshes. In partnership West Coast Environmental Law, we are also working to translate this blue carbon science into policy-relevant information for municipalities and provincial governments. \n\nOur research group is also involved in the NSF funded Coastal Carbon Research Coordination Network. Specifically, we are involved in the Methane Working Group, which aims to compile all methane flux data from coastal habitats (excluding mangroves) in the CONUS to parameterize and validate a set of nested process-based methane models. \nAdditionally, we are part of a U.S. Department of Energy grant “High-frequency Data Integration for Landscape Model Calibration of Carbon Fluxes Across Diverse Tidal Marshes” focused on leveraging eddy covariance observations to improve landscape-scale models of carbon fluxes across tidal marshes. This grant brings together university and government researchers from across the U.S. \nI am also a co-investigator on a collaborative research effort to model the current and future mitigation capacity of Canada’s blue carbon ecosystems, which was recently funded by an NSERC Alliance grant. The project is led by Julia Baum (University of Victoria), and includes four co-principal investigators and seventeen collaborators from across the country which are contributing to this national natural ocean climate solutions research effort. The project brings together a consortium of four universities, three government agencies, and four eNGOs. \nPrimary Collaborators:  Oikawa Lab, California State University, East Bay  The U.S. Geological Survey  The Baum Lab, University of Victoria  O’Connor Lab, The University of British Columbia \n\n\nCarbon Cycling in the Prairie Pothole Region of Canada\n\nWith growing interest in wetland management and restoration as a Natural Climate Solution, improved estimates of wetland carbon sequestration and GHG fluxes across Canadian wetland types are strongly needed. In partnership with Ducks Unlimited Canada, we focus on wetlands in the Prairie Pothole Region of western Canada since these ecosystems are understudied relative to other wetland types in Canada, yet they play important roles in carbon cycling and climate regulation. Specifically, this study leverages existing funding and infrastructure to investigate carbon and GHG dynamics across two wetland sites, with the aims of measuring and modeling GHG fluxes in prairie wetlands in Manitoba.\nPrimary Collaborators:  Ducks Unlimited Canada - Pascal Badiou \nPrairie Wetlands in the News:  May 19, 2022 - Project intended to demonstrate wetlands’ greenhouse gas impact  April 20, 2022 - DUC analyzing wetlands on farms and ranches for carbon capture  April, 2022 - DUC Carbon Tower Project",

They are also the largest, and most uncertain, natural source of CH4 to the atmosphere. Direct observations of local CH4 emissions with high measurement frequency are important for constraining CH4 budgets, for understanding the responses of CH4 fluxes to environmental factors and climate, and for creating validation datasets for the land-surface models used to infer global CH4 budgets. However, unlike well-coordinated efforts for synthesizing CO2 flux-tower observations (e.g., FLUXNET), no such network and data synthesis effort existed previously for CH4. \n\nFLUXNET-CH4 is an initiative coordinated through the Global Carbon Project in close partnership with AmeriFlux and EuroFlux, to compile a global database of eddy covariance CH4 flux measurements to answer regional and global questions related to the global CH4 cycle. Through this activity, we coordinated the collection, aggregation, standardization, and post-processing of global CH4 data from the flux tower community. FLUXNET-CH4 Version 1.0 includes data from 81 sites, representing freshwater, coastal, upland, natural, and managed ecosystems. \nAdditionally, through a USGS Powell Center Working Group, we leveraged the FLUXNET-CH4 to provide novel insights into the controls and timing of wetland CH4 emissions for North America and globally, inform and validate biogeochemical models, and upscale wetland CH4 flux measurements globally. \nCollaborators:  Jackson Lab, Stanford University  NASA Goddard  Global Carbon Project  Stanford Machine Learning Group \n\n\nQuantifying carbon benefits of tidal wetland restoration in the Delta: Decision support using a robust, integrated and data-driven model\n\nThis research was funded through the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and focused on advancing remote sensing data in tidally flooded marshes and using the data to improve modeling of greenhouse gases in these systems. The modeling tool will be made publicly available through Google Earth Engine.

    "text": "What is a Branch?\n\n\nBranches can be thought of like limbs on a tree, or perhaps a more accurate analogy can be taken from hydrology, by comparing them to an anbranching river channel.\n\nBranches are separate “streams” of code that break off of the main “channel”. Some branches may be dead ends that don’t end up going anywhere. While some branches may lead lead to improvements that can be incorporated back into the main branch of the codebase. Others may break off from the main project entirely.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn anabranching section of the Mackenzie River Delta.\n\n\n\n\n\nBranch Protection Rules\nWe use branch protection rules to protect the main codebase. All changes to the main branch of a protected repository, must be submitted via a “pull request” using a separate branch. This allows for review of the changes by other users before changes are incorporated. It adds an extra level of security by protecting the main branch of code from the erroneous keystrokes of novice and expert users alike! These rules are act as a “gate” that helps ensure any changes to operational code are intentional and agreed upon by relevant parties. If you try to push (force) a change to the main branch of a protected repository on our GitHub, you’ll be given an error message and told to submit a pull request instead!

    "text": "Common Git Tasks\n\nCreating a Repo From Scratch\nSay you have a collection of code that you want to add to a local repository. The syntax would be as follows:\ngit init -b main\ngit add some_program.py\ngit commit -am \"First Commit: Adding my initial code to repo\"\nWhat is happening here?\ninit: Creates an empty repository with a “branch” (-b) named “main”\nadd: indicates that “some_program.py” will be tracked within the repo. Other files in the repo will not be tracked unless you explicitly add them. Alternatively bash git add . would all all files within the repo. There are more complex patterns that can be setup to explicitly exclude/include some files using “.gitignore” files, but that’s a topic for another day.\ncommit: Tells git to “save” a permanent copy of all (-a) tracked files in the repo in there current state and leave a commit message (-m) to leave important notes about the commit. Commit messages are extremely helpful, both for reminding yourself what happened, and indicating to collaborators what’s included in a commit.\n\nYou should avoid leaving short/nondescript commit messages such as “updated code”, because that doesn’t help anyone\nIt is good practice to make a commit any time you make an important change to your project!\n\n\nAdding Your New Repository to GitHub\nGo to github.com and follow the steps outlined in the images bellow:\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Create a new repository\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Give it the same name as your local repo. Accept all defaults then click create.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. The next window will open an empty repo. Copy the url go back to your local git repo and execute the commands listed bellow.\n\n\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/June-Skeeter/SomeTest.git\ngit push --set-upstream origin main\nThese commands will tell your local git where the remote (on the cloud) version of your repository is located and then “push” your local copy to the cloud. If you go back to the github repo and refresh the webpage, you’ll see that whatever files were in your local copy are now visible remotely!",

    "text": "Working With an Existing Repository\nMore often than not, you’ll end up working with an existing repository. You may need to make some changes, which can be added back to the main branch (following the branch protection rules!) or you may just need to run some fully developed code locally on your computer. For example, maybe you need to do some processing for the HOGG site in Manitoba. You can “download” a local copy of the repo and create a branch for your local changes as follows:\ngit clone https://github.com/ubc-micromet/Calculation_Procedures.git\ngit checkout -b MyHoggUpdates\nWhat is happening here?\nclone:: Tells git to download a local copy a repository from a remote location (i.e. a github URL) to your computer.\ncheckout: Tells git to create an new branch (-b) with the name “MyHoggUpdates”. This branch will contain all of your own adjustments, but the main branch on your local machine will not be altered! If you break something (e.g., delete an important code block), its easy to go back to the main branch. Just type bash git checkout main to go back in to the main branch. Note only need to add bash -b after bash checkout when creating a new branch. Git will automatically revert all files in the repo the the main version.\n\nContributing your Changes\nProvided you have permission to write to the repository (this is granted on a per-user basis by repo “owners”), you can contribute any changes you make by pushing a copy of your branch to github. Say you added a new file “new_HOGG_file.ini”, you could add it, commit it, then push to git hub as follows:\ngit add new_HOGG_file.ini\ngit commit -am \"A relevant description of your changes\"\ngit push --set-upstream origin MyHoggUpdates\nNote you only need to run the --set-upstream origin Test once per branch. The second, third, hundredth push you can simply type git push\n\n\nPulling Remote Changes\nSay there were some important updates to the main remote branch that you need to incorporate to code on your local branch. Starting from within MyHoggUpdates You could:\ngit checkout main\ngit pull\ngit checkout MyHoggUpdates\ngit merge main\npull downloads all the changes from the main branch on github to your local machine.\nmerge will automatically incorporate any changes for files that don’t conflict with changes you’ve made to files locally. i.e., if you’re working on “new_HOGG_file.ini”, but someone else changed “existing_BB_file.ini” then the updates to “existing_BB_file.ini” will be brought in without causing any “merge conflicts”. If you also made an edit to “existing_BB_file.ini” that does not match the incoming change, it will create a merge conflict, that needs to be resolved manually.",

Yet at the same time, the lands have been claimed by Canada and these First Nations living on these lands lack a framework to express their sovereignty. This by no means absolves the Canadian government of their crimes where lands were “ceded” by treaty. Treaties were more frequently reached by coercion than negotiation.

    "text": "This section provides a generic, quick-start example that converts (1) EddyPro raw data output, and (2) Campbell Scientific TOA5 output, to a formatted database ready to be processed using the standardised libraries (i.e., Biomet.net). We also present some examples of how to quickly check the contents of your new database.\n\n\nAs previously mentioned, we will follow an example that focuses on flux-related EddyPro and met-related Campbell Scientific output data:\n\nFirst, in your newly created Sites directory, within the relevant SITEID, create a new Flux folder (figure 5.1).\n\nFigure 5.1. Directory tree showing file path to the location where raw flux data for site with SITEID1 should be stored.\nCopy your EddyPro raw output data to this Flux folder. This data will remain untouched so that you always have a local copy of the original data.\nNow, create a Met folder within the same SITEID directory (SITEID1 in this example), and copy your Campbell Scientific TOA5 data for this site to this Met folder.\nIn your Matlab folder, create one new “main” Matlab file that will act as a “do-it-all” script. The example given here (figure 5.2) — named MyMicrometSitesCleaning_Main.m (you can make your filename less generic but we advise including “Main”) — will create the database, and later we will add the code for data cleaning. This script can be copied from the code block at the bottom of this page. \n\nFigure 5.2. Matlab code to create database from raw EddyPro output. Yellow highlighted text should be edited.\nNext, run your “Main” Matlab program; you should see some data output in your Database directory. Data is grouped by year, then by site, then by data type, e.g., Flux or Met (figure 5.3; Met data not shown here).\n\nFigure 5.3. Directory tree showing file path to output in Database directory following database conversion.\n\nYour data is now in a format ready for cleaning using the pipeline.\n\n\n\nHere are some quick tips to inspect the Flux data from SITEID1 in your newly created database:\n\ngui_Browse_folder function:\n pth = biomet_path(yearIn, 'SITEID1', 'Flux')  % define path to folder you wish to browse\n gui_Browse_Folder(pth)\n \nThis function opens a Matlab app that looks in the Flux folder for SITEID1 for a specific year (as defined in the biomet_path function input parameters) and plots each variable in turn. You can scroll through or use the dropdown in order to check that your data looks reasonable and as expected.\nLoad one trace, e.g., co2_mixing_ratio and plot it.\n %% Load one trace and plot it\n pth = biomet_path(yearIn,'SITEID1','Flux');   \n tv = read_bor(fullfile(pth,'clean_tv'),8);      % load the time vector (Matlab's datenum format)\n tv_dt = datetime(tv,'convertfrom','datenum');   % convert to Matlab's datetime object\n x = read_bor(fullfile(pth,'co2_mixing_ratio')); % load co2_mixing_ratio from SITEID1/Flux folder\n plot(tv_dt,x)                                   % plot data\n grid on;zoom on\n \nplotApp function:\nSimply type plotApp on the command line, and it will open an app that can compare traces from the same and different cleaning stages (once you have completed those), databases, and also produce statistical plots and outputs. More details of this and other visualization tools are described at length in section 7.\n\n\n\n\nMyMicrometSitesCleaning_Main.m template script for copying (see Figure 5.2 for necessary edits):\n%% Main function for MyMicrometSites data processing\n% Created by &lt;author&gt; on &lt;date&gt;\n% \n% ============================\n% Setup the project and siteID\nprojectPath = '/Users/&lt;username&gt;/Project/My_MicrometSites/';\nstructProject=set_TAB_project(projectPath);\nsiteID = 'SITEID1';\n\n% Create database from raw data\n%% Flux data from EddyPro output files\n%\n% Input file name\nfileName = fullfile(structProject.sitesPath,siteID,'Flux','MY_EDDYPRO_OUTPUT.csv');\n\n% Read the file \noptionsFileRead.flagFileType = 'fulloutput';    % select fulloutput, biomet, or summary\n[~, ~,tv,outStruct] = fr_read_EddyPro_file(fileName,[],[],optionsFileRead);\n\n% set database path \ndatabasePath = fullfile(db_pth_root,'yyyy',siteID,'Flux'); \n\n% Convert outStruct into database \nmissingPointValue = NaN; \ntimeUnit= '30MIN'; \nstructType = 1; \ndb_struct2database(outStruct,databasePath,0,[],timeUnit,missingPointValue,structType,1); \n\n%% Met data from Campbell Scientific TOA5 output files\n%\n% Input file name\nfileName = fullfile(structProject.sitesPath,siteID,'Met','MY_CS_TOA5_OUTPUT.csv');\n\n% Read the file \n[~,~,~,outStruct] = fr_read_TOA5_file(fileName); \n\n% set database path \ndatabasePath = fullfile(db_pth_root,'yyyy',siteID,'Met'); \n\n% Convert outStruct into database \nmissingPointValue = NaN; \ntimeUnit= '30MIN'; \nstructType = 1; \ndb_struct2database(outStruct,databasePath,0,[],timeUnit,missingPointValue,structType,1);",

We also present some examples of how to quickly check the contents of your new database.\n\n\nAs previously mentioned, we will follow an example that focuses on flux-related EddyPro and met-related Campbell Scientific output data:\n\nFirst, in your newly created Sites directory, within the relevant SITEID, create a new Flux folder (figure 5.1).\n\nFigure 5.1. Directory tree showing file path to the location where raw flux data for site with SITEID1 should be stored.\nCopy your EddyPro raw output data to this Flux folder. This data will remain untouched so that you always have a local copy of the original data.\nNow, create a Met folder within the same SITEID directory (SITEID1 in this example), and copy your Campbell Scientific TOA5 data for this site to this Met folder.\nIn your Matlab folder, create one new “main” Matlab file that will act as a “do-it-all” script. The example given here (figure 5.2) — named MyMicrometSitesCleaning_Main.m (you can make your filename less generic but we advise including “Main”) — will create the database, and later we will add the code for data cleaning. This script can be copied from the code block at the bottom of this page. \n\nFigure 5.2. Matlab code to create database from raw EddyPro output. Yellow highlighted text should be edited.\nNext, run your “Main” Matlab program; you should see some data output in your Database directory. Data is grouped by year, then by site, then by data type, e.g., Flux or Met (figure 5.3; Met data not shown here).\n\nFigure 5.3. Directory tree showing file path to output in Database directory following database conversion.\n\nYour data is now in a format ready for cleaning using the pipeline.\n\n\n\nHere are some quick tips to inspect the Flux data from SITEID1 in your newly created database:\n\ngui_Browse_folder function:\n pth = biomet_path(yearIn, 'SITEID1', 'Flux')  % define path to folder you wish to browse\n gui_Browse_Folder(pth)\n \nThis function opens a Matlab app that looks in the Flux folder for SITEID1 for a specific year (as defined in the biomet_path function input parameters) and plots each variable in turn. You can scroll through or use the dropdown in order to check that your data looks reasonable and as expected.\nLoad one trace, e.g., co2_mixing_ratio and plot it.\n %% Load one trace and plot it\n pth = biomet_path(yearIn,'SITEID1','Flux');   \n tv = read_bor(fullfile(pth,'clean_tv'),8);      % load the time vector (Matlab's datenum format)\n tv_dt = datetime(tv,'convertfrom','datenum');   % convert to Matlab's datetime object\n x = read_bor(fullfile(pth,'co2_mixing_ratio')); % load co2_mixing_ratio from SITEID1/Flux folder\n plot(tv_dt,x)                                   % plot data\n grid on;zoom on\n \nplotApp function:\nSimply type plotApp on the command line, and it will open an app that can compare traces from the same and different cleaning stages (once you have completed those), databases, and also produce statistical plots and outputs. More details of this and other visualization tools are described at length in section 7.\n\n\n\n\nMyMicrometSitesCleaning_Main.m template script for copying (see Figure 5.2 for necessary edits):\n%% Main function for MyMicrometSites data processing\n% Created by &lt;author&gt; on &lt;date&gt;\n% \n% ============================\n% Setup the project and siteID\nprojectPath = '/Users/&lt;username&gt;/Project/My_MicrometSites/';\nstructProject=set_TAB_project(projectPath);\nsiteID = 'SITEID1';\n\n% Create database from raw data\n%% Flux data from EddyPro output files\n%\n% Input file name\nfileName = fullfile(structProject.sitesPath,siteID,'Flux','MY_EDDYPRO_OUTPUT.csv');\n\n% Read the file \noptionsFileRead.flagFileType = 'fulloutput';    % select fulloutput, biomet, or summary\n[~, ~,tv,outStruct] = fr_read_EddyPro_file(fileName,[],[],optionsFileRead);\n\n% set database path \ndatabasePath = fullfile(db_pth_root,'yyyy',siteID,'Flux'); \n\n% Convert outStruct into database \nmissingPointValue = NaN; \ntimeUnit= '30MIN'; \nstructType = 1; \ndb_struct2database(outStruct,databasePath,0,[],timeUnit,missingPointValue,structType,1); \n\n%% Met data from Campbell Scientific TOA5 output files\n%\n% Input file name\nfileName = fullfile(structProject.sitesPath,siteID,'Met','MY_CS_TOA5_OUTPUT.csv');\n\n% Read the file \n[~,~,~,outStruct] = fr_read_TOA5_file(fileName); \n\n% set database path \ndatabasePath = fullfile(db_pth_root,'yyyy',siteID,'Met'); \n\n% Convert outStruct into database \nmissingPointValue = NaN; \ntimeUnit= '30MIN'; \nstructType = 1; \ndb_struct2database(outStruct,databasePath,0,[],timeUnit,missingPointValue,structType,1);",

Chart outlining the data cleaning principles followed in the pipeline.\n\n\n\n\nPrinciple: during the first stage of data cleaning we want to keep the best measured data values from each sensor, i.e., a user looking for the best measurements from a particular sensor would want to use the first stage data. Missing data points for periods of more than one half-hour will not be gap-filled in any way. \nIn summary, the first stage collects the raw data, applies min/max filtering, assigns consistent variable names in line with Ameriflux guidelines as far as possible, and moves the relevant files to a Clean folder in preparation for stage two. This folder will be created automatically if it does not already exist.\nThe data are stored as binary files in “single-precision floating-point format” (aka float 32), which importantly means they are readable in most common computer languages and softwares.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciple: the second stage focuses on creating the best measured data values for each particular property/variable. For example, if there are two (or more) collocated temperature sensors at the same height e.g., 2 metres above ground level, the second stage is intended to create the “best” trace using both (all) sensors, with the highest precision/accuracy and the fewest missing points. It does this by averaging the traces, and also gap-filling either by using linear regression, or using data from a nearby climate station or reanalysis data (other gap-filling methods are currently under evaluation).\nIn practice, the second stage collects the stage one data, generates the “best” observation for each variable and moves the relevant files to a “Clean/SecondStage” folder in preparation for stage three.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciple: USTAR filtering, gap-filling, and CO2 flux partitioning.\nThe third stage collects the stage two data and implements USTAR filtering, gap-filling, and flux partitioning procedures. For this we use the R REddyProc package which has been adapted to interface with Matlab, so that all three stages can be run together. For more machine learning approaches to gap-filling, we also implement the random forest approach described in the paper by Kim et al. (2020).\n\nWe achieve these principles by setting up various configuration files used in each stage. This process is described later (section 6), but there are a few more steps to complete before that. Next, you will set up your project directory structure, then configure it to work with the Biomet.net library.",
