	abstract = {Quantifying the emissions of the three main biogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4), from agroecosystems is crucial. In this study continuous measurements of N2O, and CH4 emissions from potato and pea crops in southwest British Columbia, Canada were made using the eddy-covariance (EC) technique. Flux footprint analysis, coupled with EC and manual nonsteady state chamber measurements, was used to address the spatial heterogeneity resulting from the field edge at the study site. Flux footprint corrections had a larger effect on N2O fluxes than CO2 fluxes because of a more pronounced difference in N2O fluxes between the crop and edge areas. After flux footprint corrections, the potato and pea crops were both weak CO2 sinks with annual net ecosystem exchange values of −57 ± 9 and −97 ± 16 g C m−2 yr−1, respectively. However, after taking carbon (C) export via crop harvest and C import via seeding into account, the potato crop shifted to being a moderate C source of 284 ± 55 g C m−2 yr−1, while the pea crop became near C neutral, sequestering only 30 ± 26 g C m−2 yr−1. Annual GHG balances, quantified by converting N2O and CH4 to CO2 equivalents as pulse emissions using respective global warming potentials on a 100-year timescale, were 417 ± 88 and 152 ± 106 g CO2e m−2 yr−1 for the potato and pea crops, respectively, with N2O contributing the largest proportion to annual total GHG balances and outweighing the CO2 uptake from the atmosphere.},

	abstract = {Peatland drainage depletes large carbon stocks by increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the soil. Restoration via re-wetting could play an important role in climate change mitigation, reducing CO2 emissions and increasing C storage within peatlands. However, re-wetting leads to a biogeochemical compromise between increased CO2 uptake, and enhanced methane (CH4) release. The extent of this compromise in re-wetted ecosystems with differing environmental conditions is uncertain. To assess re-wetting effects, we analyzed eddy-covariance flux measurements from a temperate bog near Vancouver, Canada, from two sites that have undergone different restoration techniques. By the end of the 1-year study period, the actively re-wetted, wetter site, was a weak CO2 sink (−26.1 ± 6.1 g C-CO2 m−2), and the passively re-wetted, drier site, was near CO2 neutral (3.8 ± 3.1 g C-CO2 m−2). Higher CH4 emissions at the wetter site led to a larger radiative balance on 20- and 100-year time horizons, implying that the strong radiative effect of CH4 can offset CO2 sink strength on shorter to medium timeframes. However, long-term radiative forcing (RF) modeling suggests sustained CO2 uptake by the wetter site will eventually lead to a cooling effect on the climate. Furthermore, modeling results emphasize that despite both re-wetted peatland sites having a positive RF over century timescales, the lack of restoration would have resulted in a significantly larger RF beyond the first few decades following restoration. Results highlight the importance of actively re-wetting disturbed peatlands to mitigate climate warming and can be used to inform management decisions.},

	abstract = {Rewetting of disturbed peatlands is an important restoration strategy for climate change mitigation. Previous work primarily focuses on the biogeochemical processes altered by rewetting and few studies have investigated the biophysical impacts, which can diminish or amplify biogeochemical effects beyond the ecosystem scale. We used a paired flux tower approach in a restored peatland to collect year-round eddy covariance data to assess the biophysical impacts of disturbance and management practices. The first site was actively rewetted and is characterized by Sphagnum and white beak-rush with patches of open water. The second site represents a disturbed ecosystem, which underwent natural regeneration and is dominated by scrub pine, Sphagnum, and low shrubs. We found that the actively restored site had higher net radiation compared to the second site due to more surface water ponding and however, the higher aerodynamic conductance at the passively restored site contributed to enhanced daytime turbulent fluxes, and hence, both sites had similar aerodynamic temperatures during the daytime. The actively restored site experienced warmer nighttime and seasonal aerodynamic temperature as much of the excess radiation during the day was stored in the water column and released at night. To achieve restoration goals, higher water tables are now maintained throughout large sections of the bog. The study implies that water table manipulation has the potential to minimize greenhouse gas emissions from the bog, thereby allowing the biophysical impacts of peatland restoration to enhance the biogeochemical benefits. Therefore, it is important to consider both biophysical and biogeochemical changes in peatland restoration management.},

	abstract = {Wetland CH4 emissions are among the most uncertain components of the global CH4 budget. The complex nature of wetland CH4 processes makes it challenging to identify causal relationships for improving our understanding and predictability of CH4 emissions. In this study, we used the flux measurements of CH4 from eddy covariance towers (30 sites from 4 wetlands types: bog, fen, marsh, and wet tundra) to construct a causality-constrained machine learning (ML) framework to explain the regulative factors and to capture CH4 emissions at sub-seasonal scale. We found that soil temperature is the dominant factor for CH4 emissions in all studied wetland types. Ecosystem respiration (CO2) and gross primary productivity exert controls at bog, fen, and marsh sites with lagged responses of days to weeks. Integrating these asynchronous environmental and biological causal relationships in predictive models significantly improved model performance. More importantly, modeled CH4 emissions differed by up to a factor of 4 under a +1$\,^{\circ}$C warming scenario when causality constraints were considered. These results highlight the significant role of causality in modeling wetland CH4 emissions especially under future warming conditions, while traditional data-driven ML models may reproduce observations for the wrong reasons. Our proposed causality-guided model could benefit predictive modeling, large-scale upscaling, data gap-filling, and surrogate modeling of wetland CH4 emissions within earth system land models.},

  abstract = {While growth history of vegetation within upland systems is well studied, plant phenology within coastal tidal systems is less understood. Landscape-scale, satellite-derived indicators of plant greenness may not adequately represent seasonality of vegetation biomass and productivity within tidal wetlands due to limitations of cloud cover, satellite temporal frequency, and attenuation of plant signals by tidal flooding. However, understanding plant phenology is necessary to gain insight into aboveground biomass, photosynthetic activity, and carbon sequestration. In this study, we use a modeling approach to estimate plant greenness throughout a year in tidal wetlands located within the San Francisco Bay Area, USA. We used variables such as EVI history, temperature, and elevation to predict plant greenness on a 14-day timestep. We found this approach accurately estimated plant greenness, with larger error observed within more dynamic restored wetlands, particularly at early post-restoration stages. We also found modeled EVI can be used as an input variable into greenhouse gas models, allowing for an estimate of carbon sequestration and gross primary production. Our strategy can be further developed in future research by assessing restoration and management effects on wetland phenological dynamics and through incorporating the entire Sentinel-2 time series once it becomes available within Google Earth Engine.},

  abstract = {Time series of wetland methane fluxes measured by eddy covariance require gap-filling to estimate daily, seasonal, and annual emissions. Gap-filling methane fluxes is challenging because of high variability and complex responses to multiple drivers. To date, there is no widely established gap-filling standard for wetland methane fluxes, with regards both to the best model algorithms and predictors. This study synthesizes results of different gap-filling methods systematically applied at 17 wetland sites spanning boreal to tropical regions and including all major wetland classes and two rice paddies. Procedures are proposed for: 1) creating realistic artificial gap scenarios, 2) training and evaluating gap-filling models without overstating performance, and 3) predicting half-hourly methane fluxes and annual emissions with realistic uncertainty estimates. Performance is compared between a conventional method (marginal distribution sampling) and four machine learning algorithms. The conventional method achieved similar median performance as the machine learning models but was worse than the best machine learning models and relatively insensitive to predictor choices. Of the machine learning models, decision tree algorithms performed the best in cross-validation experiments, even with a baseline predictor set, and artificial neural networks showed comparable performance when using all predictors. Soil temperature was frequently the most important predictor whilst water table depth was important at sites with substantial water table fluctuations, highlighting the value of data on wetland soil conditions. Raw gap-filling uncertainties from the machine learning models were underestimated and we propose a method to calibrate uncertainties to observations. The python code for model development, evaluation, and uncertainty estimation is publicly available. This study outlines a modular and robust machine learning workflow and makes recommendations for, and evaluates an improved baseline of, methane gap-filling models that can be implemented in multi-site syntheses or standardized products from regional and global flux networks (e.g., FLUXNET).},

  abstract = {Abstract While wetlands are the largest natural source of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere, they represent a large source of uncertainty in the global CH4 budget due to the complex biogeochemical controls on CH4 dynamics. Here we present, to our knowledge, the first multi-site synthesis of how predictors of CH4 fluxes (FCH4) in freshwater wetlands vary across wetland types at diel, multiday (synoptic), and seasonal time scales. We used several statistical approaches (correlation analysis, generalized additive modeling, mutual information, and random forests) in a wavelet-based multi-resolution framework to assess the importance of environmental predictors, nonlinearities and lags on FCH4 across 23 eddy covariance sites. Seasonally, soil and air temperature were dominant predictors of FCH4 at sites with smaller seasonal variation in water table depth (WTD). In contrast, WTD was the dominant predictor for wetlands with smaller variations in temperature (e.g., seasonal tropical/subtropical wetlands). Changes in seasonal FCH4 lagged fluctuations in WTD by ~17 ± 11 days, and lagged air and soil temperature by median values of 8 ± 16 and 5 ± 15 days, respectively. Temperature and WTD were also dominant predictors at the multiday scale. Atmospheric pressure (PA) was another important multiday scale predictor for peat-dominated sites, with drops in PA coinciding with synchronous releases of CH4. At the diel scale, synchronous relationships with latent heat flux and vapor pressure deficit suggest that physical processes controlling evaporation and boundary layer mixing exert similar controls on CH4 volatilization, and suggest the influence of pressurized ventilation in aerenchymatous vegetation. In addition, 1- to 4-h lagged relationships with ecosystem photosynthesis indicate recent carbon substrates, such as root exudates, may also control FCH4. By addressing issues of scale, asynchrony, and nonlinearity, this work improves understanding of the predictors and timing of wetland FCH4 that can inform future studies and models, and help constrain wetland CH4 emissions.},

  abstract = {Methane (CH4) emissions from natural landscapes constitute roughly half of global CH4 contributions to the atmosphere, yet large uncertainties remain in the absolute magnitude and the seasonality of emission quantities and drivers. Eddy covariance (EC) measurements of CH4 flux are ideal for constraining ecosystem-scale CH4 emissions due to quasi-continuous and high-temporal-resolution CH4 flux measurements, coincident carbon dioxide, water, and energy flux measurements, lack of ecosystem disturbance, and increased availability of datasets over the last decade. Here, we (1) describe the newly published dataset, FLUXNET-CH4 Version 1.0, the first open-source global dataset of CH4 EC measurements (available at https://fluxnet.org/data/fluxnet-ch4-community-product/, last access: 7 April 2021). FLUXNET-CH4 includes half-hourly and daily gap-filled and non-gap-filled aggregated CH4 fluxes and meteorological data from 79 sites globally: 42 freshwater wetlands, 6 brackish and saline wetlands, 7 formerly drained ecosystems, 7 rice paddy sites, 2 lakes, and 15 uplands. Then, we (2) evaluate FLUXNET-CH4 representativeness for freshwater wetland coverage globally because the majority of sites in FLUXNET-CH4 Version 1.0 are freshwater wetlands which are a substantial source of total atmospheric CH4 emissions; and (3) we provide the first global estimates of the seasonal variability and seasonality predictors of freshwater wetland CH4 fluxes. Our representativeness analysis suggests that the freshwater wetland sites in the dataset cover global wetland bioclimatic attributes (encompassing energy, moisture, and vegetation-related parameters) in arctic, boreal, and temperate regions but only sparsely cover humid tropical regions. Seasonality metrics of wetland CH4 emissions vary considerably across latitudinal bands. In freshwater wetlands (except those between 20∘ S to 20∘ N) the spring onset of elevated CH4 emissions starts 3 d earlier, and the CH4 emission season lasts 4 d longer, for each degree Celsius increase in mean annual air temperature. On average, the spring onset of increasing CH4 emissions lags behind soil warming by 1 month, with very few sites experiencing increased CH4 emissions prior to the onset of soil warming. In contrast, roughly half of these sites experience the spring onset of rising CH4 emissions prior to the spring increase in gross primary productivity (GPP). The timing of peak summer CH4 emissions does not correlate with the timing for either peak summer temperature or peak GPP. Our results provide seasonality parameters for CH4 modeling and highlight seasonality metrics that cannot be predicted by temperature or GPP (i.e., seasonality of CH4 peak). FLUXNET-CH4 is a powerful new resource for diagnosing and understanding the role of terrestrial ecosystems and climate drivers in the global CH4 cycle, and future additions of sites in tropical ecosystems and site years of data collection will provide added value to this database. All seasonality parameters are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4672601 (Delwiche et al., 2021). Additionally, raw FLUXNET-CH4 data used to extract seasonality parameters can be downloaded from https://fluxnet.org/data/fluxnet-ch4-community-product/ (last access: 7 April 2021), and a complete list of the 79 individual site data DOIs is provided in Table 2 of this paper.},

  abstract = {Wetland methane (CH4) emissions ({\$}{\$}{\{}F{\}}{\_}{\{}{\{}{\{}CH{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}4{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}) are important in global carbon budgets and climate change assessments. Currently, {\$}{\$}{\{}F{\}}{\_}{\{}{\{}{\{}CH{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}4{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}projections rely on prescribed static temperature sensitivity that varies among biogeochemical models. Meta-analyses have proposed a consistent {\$}{\$}{\{}F{\}}{\_}{\{}{\{}{\{}CH{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}4{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}temperature dependence across spatial scales for use in models; however, site-level studies demonstrate that {\$}{\$}{\{}F{\}}{\_}{\{}{\{}{\{}CH{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}4{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}are often controlled by factors beyond temperature. Here, we evaluate the relationship between {\$}{\$}{\{}F{\}}{\_}{\{}{\{}{\{}CH{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}4{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}and temperature using observations from the FLUXNET-CH4 database. Measurements collected across the globe show substantial seasonal hysteresis between {\$}{\$}{\{}F{\}}{\_}{\{}{\{}{\{}CH{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}4{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}and temperature, suggesting larger {\$}{\$}{\{}F{\}}{\_}{\{}{\{}{\{}CH{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}4{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}sensitivity to temperature later in the frost-free season (about 77{\%} of site-years). Results derived from a machine-learning model and several regression models highlight the importance of representing the large spatial and temporal variability within site-years and ecosystem types. Mechanistic advancements in biogeochemical model parameterization and detailed measurements in factors modulating CH4 production are thus needed to improve global CH4 budget assessments.},

  abstract = {Seasonal phenological dynamics of vegetation hold important clues on ecosystem performance towards management goals, such as carbon uptake, and thus should be considered in projections of their targeted services. However, in wetlands spatio-temporal heterogeneity due to mixing of open water, soil, green and dead vegetation makes it difficult to generalize ecosystem functioning across different regions. Remote sensing observations can provide spatially-explicit, cost-effective phenology indicators; however, little is known about their capacity to indicate the links between wetland ecosystem structure and function. Here we assessed this potential by comparing one-year Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from satellite products at high (5m; RapidEye) and low (30m; Landsat) spatial resolutions with eddy covariance time series of net carbon exchange, field digital camera (phenocam) greenness and water temperature among three floristically similar restored wetlands in California, USA. Phenological timing differed by wetland site: depending on satellite, the range in site-median start of greening was up to 28 days, end of greening – up to 73 days, start of senescence – up to 79 days, and end of senescence – up to 10 days. Key transition dates from satellite inputs agreed with seasonal changes in net carbon exchange, phenocam greenness and water temperatures, suggesting that phenological contrasts could result in part from site differences in vegetation configuration and litter affecting the exposure of canopy, soil and water to sunlight and thus sub-canopy microclimate and ecosystem functioning. Yet, the agreement between satellite inputs was non-systematic, with the greatest disparities at the more heterogeneous, less vegetated site. Phenological model fitting uncertainty increased with greater spatial resolution, highlighting the tradeoff between the accuracy of representing vegetation and the complexity of local seasonal variation. These findings highlight the sensitivity of satellite-derived phenology to structural and functional heterogeneity of ecosystems and call for more rigorous spatially-explicit analyses to inform assessments of restoration and management outcomes.},

  abstract = {Abstract Methane flux (FCH4) measurements using the eddy covariance technique have increased over the past decade. FCH4 measurements commonly include data gaps, as is the case with CO2 and energy fluxes. However, gap-filling FCH4 data are more challenging than other fluxes due to its unique characteristics including multidriver dependency, variabilities across multiple timescales, nonstationarity, spatial heterogeneity of flux footprints, and lagged influence of biophysical drivers. Some researchers have applied a marginal distribution sampling (MDS) algorithm, a standard gap-filling method for other fluxes, to FCH4 datasets, and others have applied artificial neural networks (ANN) to resolve the challenging characteristics of FCH4. However, there is still no consensus regarding FCH4 gap-filling methods due to limited comparative research. We are not aware of the applications of machine learning (ML) algorithms beyond ANN to FCH4 datasets. Here, we compare the performance of MDS and three ML algorithms (ANN, random forest [RF], and support vector machine [SVM]) using multiple combinations of ancillary variables. In addition, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) as an input to the algorithms to address multidriver dependency of FCH4 and reduce the internal complexity of the algorithmic structures. We applied this approach to five benchmark FCH4 datasets from both natural and managed systems located in temperate and tropical wetlands and rice paddies. Results indicate that PCA improved the performance of MDS compared to traditional inputs. ML algorithms performed better when using all available biophysical variables compared to using PCA-derived inputs. Overall, RF was found to outperform other techniques for all sites. We found gap-filling uncertainty is much larger than measurement uncertainty in accumulated CH4 budget. Therefore, the approach used for FCH4 gap filling can have important implications for characterizing annual ecosystem-scale methane budgets, the accuracy of which is important for evaluating natural and managed systems and their interactions with global change processes.},

  abstract = {Abstract We investigated the direct and indirect influence of tides on net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2) in a temperate brackish tidal marsh. NEE displayed a tidally driven pattern with obvious characteristics at the multiday scale, with greater net CO2 uptake during spring tides than neap tides. Based on the relative mutual information between NEE and biophysical variables, this was driven by a combination of higher water table depth (WTD), cooler air temperature, and lower vapor pressure deficit (VPD) during spring tides relative to neap tides, as the fortnightly tidal cycle not only influenced water levels but also strongly modulated water and air temperature and VPD. Tides also influenced NEE at shorter timescales, with a reduction in nighttime fluxes during growing season spring tides when the higher of the two semidiurnal tides caused inundation at the site. WTD significantly influenced ecosystem respiration (Reco), with lower Reco during spring tides than neap tides. While WTD did not appear to affect ecosystem photosynthesis (gross ecosystem production, GPP) directly, the impact of tides on temperature and VPD influenced GPP, with higher daily light-use efficiency and photosynthetic activity during spring tides than neap tides when temperature and VPD were lower. The strong direct and indirect influence of tides on NEE across the diel and multiday timescales has important implications for modeling NEE in tidal wetlands and can help inform the timing and frequency of chamber measurements as annual or seasonal net CO2 uptake may be underestimated if measurements are only taken during nonflooded periods.},

  abstract = {Water is a limited and valuable resource in California. A large proportion of the fresh water for southern California is supplied by the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers. With recent efforts to restore large areas of land in the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta region from farmland to managed wetlands, it is important to investigate the effect of wetland restoration on the local water cycle. We measured evapotranspiration using the eddy covariance method over six different sites in the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta from 2013 to 2016. The three restored wetlands sites differed in time since restoration and wetland structure, i.e. the area of open water compared to closed vegetation. The three agricultural sites were a flooded rice field, an alfalfa field, and a grazed cattle pasture. In most years, annual evapotranspiration was significantly lower at the drained agricultural sites, with 652 ± 131 mm (2 year average ± standard deviation, SD) for the pasture and 901 ± 24 mm (3 year average ± SD) for the alfalfa field, compared to the two open water wetlands, with 1091 ± 144 mm (4 year average ± SD) for the Mayberry wetland and 1140 ± 67 mm (3 year average ± SD) at the East End wetland. Annual evapotranspiration at the flooded rice site (975 ± 50 mm, 4 year average ± SD) or the closed vegetation wetland (West Pond wetland, 996 ± 63 mm, 4 year average ± SD) was not significantly different from the drained alfalfa site across individual years. Our analysis showed that the structural difference between the wetlands, specifically the fraction of open water compared to closed vegetation, has a large impact on evapotranspiration dynamics. Through analysis of normalized equilibrium evaporation and nighttime evapotranspiration measurements we deduced that evapotranspiration at the wetland with a low fraction of open water surfaces was almost entirely dominated by plant transpiration with very little contribution from evaporation, despite the fact that the site was flooded and water was readily available. Both evaporation and transpiration contributed substantially to evapotranspiration at the two wetlands with larger fraction of open water surfaces. At the closed canopy site evaporation from subcanopy water seemed to be inhibited through two mechanisms: first, the closed canopy prevented heating of the water column and led to significantly cooler water temperatures, which reduced surface vapor pressure. Second, the closed canopy decoupled the water surface from the atmosphere and inhibited turbulent transport of water vapor away from the water surface. Our results provide valuable insights into the water use in California wetlands and can inform decisions on how to maximize water conservation during wetland restoration.},

  abstract = {Abstract Peatland drainage is an important driver of global soil carbon loss and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Restoration of peatlands by reflooding reverses CO2 losses at the cost of increased methane (CH4) emissions, presenting a biogeochemical compromise. While restoring peatlands is a potentially effective method for sequestering carbon, the terms of this compromise are not well constrained. Here we present 14 site years of continuous CH4 and CO2 ecosystem-scale gas exchange over a network of restored freshwater wetlands in California, where long growing seasons, warm weather, and managed water tables result in some of the largest wetland ecosystem CH4 emissions recorded. These large CH4 emissions cause the wetlands to be strong greenhouse gas sources while sequestering carbon and building peat soil. The terms of this biogeochemical compromise, dictated by the ratio between carbon sequestration and CH4 emission, vary considerably across small spatial scales, despite nearly identical wetland climate, hydrology, and plant community compositions.},

  abstract = {Abstract Natural methyl chloride (CH3Cl) and methyl bromide (CH3Br) emissions from coastal marsh ecosystems may constitute a significant proportion of stratospheric chlorine and bromine, which catalyze ozone depletion. Current inventories involve substantial uncertainties associated with upscaling plot-scale footprints (i.e., ≤1 m2). Here we present net ecosystem flux measurements of methyl halides from a brackish tidal marsh on the west coast of the United States between April 2016 and June 2017 using the relaxed eddy accumulation method. The measurement footprint encompasses a large part of the studied tidal marsh, including roughly 20 vascular plant species, open water, and soil surfaces. On the annual scale, ecosystem methyl halide emissions showed the strongest relationships to temperature and the growth cycle of halophyte vegetation, whereas on diurnal time scales, fluxes correlated the most with evapotranspiration. The maximum seasonal emissions occurred during the flowering season of Lepidium latifolium (perennial pepperweed), one of the most abundant halophytes on site. The maximum hourly emissions of 111 μg CH3Cl · m−2 s· hr−1 and 38 μg CH3Br · m−2 · hr−1 were observed during a heat wave in early June. Annually integrated emissions were 135 mg/m2 for CH3Cl and 21 mg/m2 for CH3Br, scaling up to 621 and 96 kg over the entire marsh. We provide a global salt marsh emission inventory that takes into account the spatial distribution of salt marshes in different climate zones, yielding a global salt marsh source of 31 Gg/year CH3Cl (range: 10 to 77) and 3 Gg/year CH3Br (range: 1 to 8).},

  abstract = {Coastal wetlands store carbon dioxide (CO2) and emit CO2 and methane (CH4) making them an important part of greenhouse gas (GHG) inventorying. In the contiguous United States (CONUS), a coastal wetland inventory was recently calculated by combining maps of wetland type and change with soil, biomass, and CH4 flux data from a literature review. We assess uncertainty in this developing carbon monitoring system to quantify confidence in the inventory process itself and to prioritize future research. We provide a value-added analysis by defining types and scales of uncertainty for assumptions, burial and emissions datasets, and wetland maps, simulating 10 000 iterations of a simplified version of the inventory, and performing a sensitivity analysis. Coastal wetlands were likely a source of net-CO2-equivalent (CO2e) emissions from 2006–2011. Although stable estuarine wetlands were likely a CO2e sink, this effect was counteracted by catastrophic soil losses in the Gulf Coast, and CH4 emissions from tidal freshwater wetlands. The direction and magnitude of total CONUS CO2e flux were most sensitive to uncertainty in emissions and burial data, and assumptions about how to calculate the inventory. Critical data uncertainties included CH4 emissions for stable freshwater wetlands and carbon burial rates for all coastal wetlands. Critical assumptions included the average depth of soil affected by erosion events, the method used to convert CH4 fluxes to CO2e, and the fraction of carbon lost to the atmosphere following an erosion event. The inventory was relatively insensitive to mapping uncertainties. Future versions could be improved by collecting additional data, especially the depth affected by loss events, and by better mapping salinity and inundation gradients relevant to key GHG fluxes.

  abstract = {Accurate information on the gross primary production (GPP) of paddy rice cropland is critical for assessing and monitoring rice growing conditions. The eddy co-variance technique was used to measure net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 between paddy rice croplands and the atmosphere, and the resultant NEE data then partitioned into GPP (GPPEC) and ecosystem respiration. In this study, we first used the GPPEC data from four paddy rice flux tower sites in South Korea, Japan and the USA to evaluate the biophysical performance of three vegetation indices: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI); Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) in terms of phenology (crop growing seasons) and GPPEC, which are derived from images taken by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors. We also ran the Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM), which is driven by EVI, LSWI, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and air temperature, to estimate GPP over multiple years at these four sites (GPPVPM). The 14 site-years of simulations show that the seasonal dynamics of GPPVPM successfully tracked the seasonal dynamics of GPPEC (R2>0.88 or higher). The cross-site comparison also shows that GPPVPM agreed reasonably well with the variations of GPPEC across both years and sites. The simulation results clearly demonstrate the potential of the VPM model and MODIS images for estimating GPP of paddy rice croplands in the monsoon climates of South Korea and Japan and the Mediterranean climate in California, USA. The application of VPM to regional simulations in the near future may provide crucial GPP data to support the studies of food security and cropland carbon cycle around the world.},

  abstract = {Abstract We present 6.5 years of eddy covariance measurements of fluxes of methane (FCH4) and carbon dioxide (FCO2) from a flooded rice paddy in Northern California, USA. A pronounced warming trend throughout the study associated with drought and record high temperatures strongly influenced carbon (C) budgets and provided insights into biophysical controls of FCO2 and FCH4. Wavelet analysis indicated that photosynthesis (gross ecosystem production, GEP) induced the diel pattern in FCH4, but soil temperature (Ts) modulated its amplitude. Forward stepwise linear models and neural networking modeling were used to assess the variables regulating seasonal FCH4. As expected due to their competence in modeling nonlinear relationships, neural network models explained considerably more of the variance in daily average FCH4 than linear models. During the growing season, GEP and water levels typically explained most of the variance in daily average FCH4. However, Ts explained much of the interannual variability in annual and growing season CH4 sums. Higher Ts also increased the annual and growing season ratio of FCH4 to GEP. The observation that the FCH4 to GEP ratio scales predictably with Ts may help improve global estimates of FCH4 from rice agriculture. Additionally, Ts strongly influenced ecosystem respiration, resulting in large interannual variability in the net C budget at the paddy, emphasizing the need for long-term measurements particularly under changing climatic conditions.},

  abstract = {Abstract Temperate freshwater wetlands are among the most productive terrestrial ecosystems, stimulating interest in using restored wetlands as biological carbon sequestration projects for greenhouse gas reduction programs. In this study, we used the eddy covariance technique to measure surface energy carbon fluxes from a constructed, impounded freshwater wetland during two annual periods that were 8 years apart: 2002–2003 and 2010–2011. During 2010–2011, we measured methane (CH4) fluxes to quantify the annual atmospheric carbon mass balance and its concomitant influence on global warming potential (GWP). Peak growing season fluxes of latent heat and carbon dioxide (CO2) were greater in 2002–2003 compared to 2010–2011. In 2002, the daily net ecosystem exchange reached as low as −10.6 g C m−2 d−1, which was greater than 3 times the magnitude observed in 2010 (−2.9 g C m−2 d−1). CH4 fluxes during 2010–2011 were positive throughout the year and followed a strong seasonal pattern, ranging from 38.1 mg C m−2 d−1 in the winter to 375.9 mg C m−2 d−1 during the summer. The results of this study suggest that the wetland had reduced gross ecosystem productivity in 2010–2011, likely due to the increase in dead plant biomass (standing litter) that inhibited the generation of new vegetation growth. In 2010–2011, there was a net positive GWP (675.3 g C m−2 yr−1), and when these values are evaluated as a sustained flux, the wetland will not reach radiative balance even after 500 years.},

  abstract = {Abstract Methane (CH4) exchange in wetlands is complex, involving nonlinear asynchronous processes across diverse time scales. These processes and time scales are poorly characterized at the whole-ecosystem level, yet are crucial for accurate representation of CH4 exchange in process models. We used a combination of wavelet analysis and information theory to analyze interactions between whole-ecosystem CH4 flux and biophysical drivers in two restored wetlands of Northern California from hourly to seasonal time scales, explicitly questioning assumptions of linear, synchronous, single-scale analysis. Although seasonal variability in CH4 exchange was dominantly and synchronously controlled by soil temperature, water table fluctuations, and plant activity were important synchronous and asynchronous controls at shorter time scales that propagated to the seasonal scale. Intermittent, subsurface water table decline promoted short-term pulses of methane emission but ultimately decreased seasonal CH4 emission through subsequent inhibition after rewetting. Methane efflux also shared information with evapotranspiration from hourly to multiday scales and the strength and timing of hourly and diel interactions suggested the strong importance of internal gas transport in regulating short-term emission. Traditional linear correlation analysis was generally capable of capturing the major diel and seasonal relationships, but mesoscale, asynchronous interactions and nonlinear, cross-scale effects were unresolved yet important for a deeper understanding of methane flux dynamics. We encourage wider use of these methods to aid interpretation and modeling of long-term continuous measurements of trace gas and energy exchange.},

  abstract = {Measurements of hyperspectral canopy reflectance provide a detailed snapshot of information regarding canopy biochemistry, structure and physiology. In this study, we collected 5 years of repeated canopy hyperspectral reflectance measurements for a total of over 100 site visits within the flux footprints of two eddy covariance towers at a pasture and rice paddy in northern California. The vegetation at both sites exhibited dynamic phenology, with significant interannual variability in the timing of seasonal patterns that propagated into interannual variability in measured hyperspectral reflectance. We used partial least-squares regression (PLSR) modeling to leverage the information contained within the entire canopy reflectance spectra (400–900 nm) in order to investigate questions regarding the connection between measured hyperspectral reflectance and landscape-scale fluxes of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and gross primary productivity (GPP) across multiple timescales, from instantaneous flux to monthly integrated flux. With the PLSR models developed from this large data set we achieved a high level of predictability for both NEE and GPP flux in these two ecosystems, where the R2 of prediction with an independent validation data set ranged from 0.24 to 0.69. The PLSR models achieved the highest skill at predicting the integrated GPP flux for the week prior to the hyperspectral canopy reflectance collection, whereas the NEE flux often achieved the same high predictive power at daily to monthly integrated flux timescales. The high level of predictability achieved by PLSR in this study demonstrated the potential for using repeated hyperspectral canopy reflectance measurements to help partition NEE into its component fluxes, GPP and ecosystem respiration, and for using quasi-continuous hyperspectral reflectance measurements to model regional carbon flux in future analyses.},

  abstract = {Abstract Agricultural drainage of organic soils has resulted in vast soil subsidence and contributed to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California was drained over a century ago for agriculture and human settlement and has since experienced subsidence rates that are among the highest in the world. It is recognized that drained agriculture in the Delta is unsustainable in the long-term, and to help reverse subsidence and capture carbon (C) there is an interest in restoring drained agricultural land-use types to flooded conditions. However, flooding may increase methane (CH4) emissions. We conducted a full year of simultaneous eddy covariance measurements at two conventional drained agricultural peatlands (a pasture and a corn field) and three flooded land-use types (a rice paddy and two restored wetlands) to assess the impact of drained to flooded land-use change on CO2 and CH4 fluxes in the Delta. We found that the drained sites were net C and greenhouse gas (GHG) sources, releasing up to 341 g C m−2 yr−1 as CO2 and 11.4 g C m−2 yr−1 as CH4. Conversely, the restored wetlands were net sinks of atmospheric CO2, sequestering up to 397 g C m−2 yr−1. However, they were large sources of CH4, with emissions ranging from 39 to 53 g C m−2 yr−1. In terms of the full GHG budget, the restored wetlands could be either GHG sources or sinks. Although the rice paddy was a small atmospheric CO2 sink, when considering harvest and CH4 emissions, it acted as both a C and GHG source. Annual photosynthesis was similar between sites, but flooding at the restored sites inhibited ecosystem respiration, making them net CO2 sinks. This study suggests that converting drained agricultural peat soils to flooded land-use types can help reduce or reverse soil subsidence and reduce GHG emissions.},

  abstract = {The retreat of glaciers in the tropics will have a significant impact on water resources. In order to overcome limitations with discontinuous to nonexistent hydrologic measurements in remote mountain watersheds, a hydrochemical and isotopic mass balance model is used to identify and characterize dry season water origins at the glacier fed Querococha basin located in southern Cordillera Blanca, Peru. Dry season water samples, collected intermittently between 1998 and 2007, were analyzed for major ions and the stable isotopes of water (&delta;<sup>18</sup>O and &delta;<sup>2</sup>H). The hydrochemical and isotopic data are analysed using conservative characteristics of selected tracers and relative contributions are calculated based on pre-identified contributing sources at mixing points sampled across the basin. The results show that during the dry-season, groundwater is the largest contributor to basin outflow and that the flux of groundwater is temporally variable. The groundwater contribution significantly correlates (P-value=0.004 to 0.044) to the antecedent precipitation regime at 3 and 18–36 months. Assuming this indicates a maximum of 4 years of precipitation accumulation in groundwater reserves, the Querococha watershed outflows are potentially vulnerable to multi-year droughts and climate related changes in the precipitation regime. The results show that the use of hydrochemical and isotopic data can contribute to hydrologic studies in remote, data poor regions, and that groundwater contribution to tropical proglacial hydrologic systems is a critical component of dry season discharge.},
