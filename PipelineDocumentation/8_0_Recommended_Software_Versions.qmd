#### Software Overview

* All three stages of data cleaning can be run from **Matlab**. <!-- [link to Install_Matlab.md]. --> 

* Note that the third stage Matlab script invokes an **R**-script, which you will also need installed on your local computer. <!-- [link to R/RStudio installation instructions]. -->

* The scripts and tools that run the data cleaning are kept in a **Git** repository<!-- [link to Clone_Biomet_Library.md]. -->

* Optionally, you can install Git and create your own **Github** account. <!-- [link to Install_Git_Create_Account_Optional.md]. --> 

* Some users may also need **Python** installed. <!-- [link to Install_Python.md]. -->
