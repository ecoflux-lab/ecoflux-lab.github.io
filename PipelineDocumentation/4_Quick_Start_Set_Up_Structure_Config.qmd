This section provides a quick-start summary for setting up your project directory structure and configuring Matlab to work with this structure. <!-- For a more detailed description of these steps see sections 4.2 and 4.3. -->

You need the file path to your project root folder for these next steps. This project directory must be on your local computer: avoid putting it on an external drive or cloud drive (like OneDrive or GDrive) as this will cause problems in the steps that follow. Additionally, avoid putting it within the Biomet.net directory.

You will also need to create a site ID that relates to the flux site you are working with. This is often an acronym based on the site name (e.g., Burns Bog has `siteID = 'BB'`, Richmond Brackish Marsh has `siteID = 'RBM'`). Note that the siteID must be all upper case.

### Instructions

1. If you have multiple flux sites, choose *one* site to begin working with. Using the Matlab command line, define your projectPath and siteID as in the following example:

    For example, if the name of your project is `My_Micromet`, and your chosen siteID is `SITEID1`, you would enter the following commands in the Matlab command window:

    *Mac example:*
    <pre>
    projectPath = '/Users/&lt;username&gt;/Projects/My_Micromet/';
    siteID = 'SITEID1';</pre>

    *PC example:*
    <pre>
    projectPath = 'C:\Projects\My_Micromet\';
    siteID = 'SITEID1';</pre>

2. Next, in Matlab, run the `create_TAB_ProjectFolders` function (which is in the `Biomet.net` library that you cloned), as follows:
    
    <pre>
    create_TAB_ProjectFolders(projectPath,siteID)</pre>    

    Both input arguments are of type "string". You can use single `''` or double `""` quotation marks for these purposes in Matlab, although technically, these mean slightly different things; see <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/string.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this link</a> for more info.Â 

    As the function name suggests, this will create some folders on your computer, and also transfer some necessary small files. In your project root directory (e.g., `My_Micromet` in figure 4.1), you should now see three new directories with the following names: (1) Database, (2) Matlab, (3) Sites.

    [Note: if you are working with an earlier version of Matlab than 2023b, you may get an error when running `create_TAB_ProjectFolders` (above). In that case, download <a href= "presentation/My_Micromet_Folder.zip">this zip file</a>, unzip, and put the *contents* of "My_Micromet_Folder" within your project directory (underneath `My_Micromet`); make sure your directory structure looks like figure 4.1.] 

3. Finally, run `set_TAB_project(projectPath)`. This process sets up the `Biomet.net` toolbox to work with your project. 

### Short description of new directory structure and contents

For now we will describe only the new directories and files necessary for you to begin data cleaning. <!-- For the long description see section 4.2 [xxx link].-->

#### Database directory
* The new `Database` directory contains a `Calculation_Procedures` directory, and within `Calculation_Procedures`, there is one called `TraceAnalysis_ini`. 

* Within `TraceAnalysis_ini`, you will see a subdirectory named using your siteID (e.g., `SITEID1` in figure 4.2), as follows:

    <img src="images/directory_trees/DirectoryTree2b_short.jpg" alt="DirectoryTree:DatabaseDirectory&Subdirectories" width="350"/>
    
    *Figure 4.2. Directory tree showing contents of `TraceAnalysis_ini` folder after running the `create_TAB_ProjectFolders` Matlab function.* 

* Eventually (but not yet!), this `Database` directory will also contain the following:
    - Initial database created using your raw data;
    - Your site-specific INI files that configure how the pipeline scripts will clean the data;
    - The cleaned data once the INI files have been created and the pipeline has been run.


#### Sites directory
* Raw, *uncleaned* data from your site(s) will be stored in the `<projectPath>/Sites` directory, under the appropriate siteID (covered shortly in section 5.1). The data in this directory should remain *untouched* since we always want to preserve a copy of the raw data.

    *Figure 4.3. Directory tree showing contents of `Sites` folder after running the `create_TAB_ProjectFolders` Matlab function.* 

#### Matlab directory
* This directory should now contain three matlab files: 
<ol>
    <li>`get_TAB_project_configuration.m` which was created "behind the scenes" in step 2 above, then used during step 3;</li>
    <li>`biomet_database_default.m`; and </li>
    <li>`biomet_sites_default.m`.</li> 
</ol>

The latter two functions are used in the pipeline behind the scenes, and may also be useful to you later when you want to visualize your data.
