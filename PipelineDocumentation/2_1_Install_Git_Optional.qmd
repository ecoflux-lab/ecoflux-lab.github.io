## 2.1. &nbsp; Install Git and create personal Github account (optional)

This step is optional. It is useful if you think you may contribute to the Biomet.net library, which is a Git repository. 

* Download the latest version of Git for Windows or Mac here: <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git</a>.

* Next, if you donâ€™t already have a personal github account, go to <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a> and set one up.

* Once these tasks are complete, if you wish to contribute your own code to the `Biomet.net` library, start by creating a separate *git branch* to work on. Once you are happy with your code, create a pull request, then someone will review and approve the new files or contact you if necessary.
