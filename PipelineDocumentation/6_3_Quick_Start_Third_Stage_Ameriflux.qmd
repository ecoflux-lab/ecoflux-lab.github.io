## 6.3. &nbsp; Quick Start: Third Stage Cleaning and Converting to Ameriflux Output

### Third Stage Cleaning

The third stage cleaning generally requires the least amount of work by the user, but is usually the most computationally intensive stage, as it includes running models for gap-filling fluxes and flux partitioning. The following example assumes you have already completed first and second stage cleaning for one site.

1. Open your site-specific `SITEID1_config.yml` for editing (figure 6.5):

    *Figure 6.5. Directory tree showing location of third stage custom YAML file that must be copied (green highlighted text) and edited (yellow highlighted text).*

2. At the top of your site-specific configuration file (i.e., `SITEID1_config.yml`), input the site ID, the year that measurements at the site began, and the metadata for your site (figure 6.6; yellow highlighted text):

   *Figure 6.6. Third stage site-specific custom YAML file showing which fields to edit in yellow highlighted text.*

	The main configuration file (`global_config.yml`) for running third stage cleaning is located in the `TraceAnalysis_ini` directory, and generally speaking this should not be edited. The custom `SITEID1_config.yml` file can be used to add parameters/inputs; these site-specific settings will overwrite those in the `global_config.yml` if they are also defined there.

    Note on gap-filling FCH4: currently the predictors for all random forest models used to fill gaps are set to: `Predictors: SW_IN_1_1_1,TA_1_1_1,VPD_1_1_1`. However, for FCH4, these inputs should be changed to prioritize soil variables such as soil temperature, soil moisture, and water table depth. You can change these settings under "Optional parameters" (figure 6.7; peach highlighting). <!-- As an active area of research, we recommend experimenting with different combinations of these inputs. -->

3. Next, test the third stage data cleaning in Matlab; remember that it can take a lot longer to run than first and second stages. Note that the cleaning stage argument for third stage cleaning is `7` (*not* 3; this is a legacy artifact), as follows:
    <pre>
    fr_automated_cleaning(yearIn,siteID,7)  % third stage</pre>
    
    The output will appear in two directories: `ThirdStage` and `ThirdStage_Default_Ustar` within the `Clean` directory, where the second stage output is; again, we recommend that you inspect this data using the visualization tools. <!--Section 6.6 [XXX link] provides more details on third stage cleaning, including adding further custom configuration and output data. -->

### Output your data to an Ameriflux CSV file

Finally, once you have inspected your clean data and are happy with your INI files, you can output the data to a CSV file formatted for submission to Ameriflux:
<pre>
fr_automated_cleaning(yearIn,SITEID,8)  % Ameriflux CSV output</pre>

The output will appear in an `Ameriflux` directory within the `Clean` directory, where the second and third stage output is.


Note that you can run all stages at once (or a subset, provided the previous stages to the subset have already been run, i.e., the data exists):
<pre>
fr_automated_cleaning(yearIn,SITEID,[1 2 7 8])  % all three stages plus Ameriflux output</pre>
