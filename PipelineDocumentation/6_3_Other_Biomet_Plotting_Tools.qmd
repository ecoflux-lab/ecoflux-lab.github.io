#### *read_bor_notes_micromet.m* function

[XXX Zoran, the examples in this function include cleaned data, which we hadn't covered at the point this was located before, so I moved it here and linked it.]

This function is intended as a manual on how to tell Matlab to read data from your newly created database, learning by example (one code section at a time, sequentially). The following notes help to describe and explain each example:

1. *Load one trace and plot it*: 
* Use the `biomet_path` function, e.g., `pth = biomet_path(2022, 'DSM', 'MET')` to give you the filepath to your data, in this case the Met data for the DSM site for all of 2022; you should not define the filepath yourself, but always use this function. 
* Use the `read_bor` function to load the time vector from the `clean_tv` file, then convert it to a datetime object using the `datetime` function.
* Use the `read_bor` function again to load the trace of your choice from the filepath you defined using `biomet_path`, e.g., `x = read_bor(fullfile(pth,'MET_CNR4_Net_Avg'))` will load the *MET_CNR4_Net_Avg* trace from the DSM Met folder for 2022, using the previously defined path.
* You can now plot your variable *x* with a nicely formatted time vector. 

2. *Compare two traces*:
* This is most useful for comparing traces from different cleaning stages, once you have cleaned your data - which we have not yet addressed. We will cover this again later in section 
* Use `biomet_path` again to define the filepath to the Second Stage clean data, e.g., `pth = biomet_path(2022,'DSM','Clean/SecondStage')` 

3. *Multiple years*: [XXX not yet complete, may need to move]

4. *Other functions for visualizing data*:
* `gui_Browse_Folder`: given a filepath, this function will open a new figure window and provide a dropdown containing all traces located at that filepath location. You can pick one or scroll through using the arrow buttons.
* `guiPlotTraces`
* `plotApp`
