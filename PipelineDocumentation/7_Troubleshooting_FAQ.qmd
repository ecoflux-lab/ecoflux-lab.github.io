### Troubleshooting: some general tips

* Before running data cleaning, first **make sure you have the most recent version of the `Biomet.net` library** (see section 2.2 for details). The code is updated regularly and you should be updating your local repository at least once per week. If you downloaded the Biomet.net library (rather than cloned it), make sure that you renamed it exactly as `Biomet.net` since the download includes "main" in the folder name.
* When running data cleaning (any stage), pay very close attention to the output on your screen. It tells you when everything runs smoothly, and if something goes wrong, in most cases it will be informative as to why and whereabouts things went wrong. 
* Avoid having extra white space in your INI file between `[TRACE]` and `[END]`. Each parameter must be defined on a new line, with no wraparound. We recommend using a text editor that has line numbers (such as VS Code) to help you avoid and/or diagnose this issue.

### FAQ

1. *I have multiple files containing data from one site, e.g., daily, monthly, or annual files. How do I create one database from all my files?*

    * See section 5.2: subsection "Create Database from Multiple Input Files and Updates for Continuous Operational Sites".

2. *I have multiple flux sites. Once I've added one site and created my database with data from that site (and cleaned it, etc.), what are the steps to move on to my next site?*

    * See section ...

3. *I replaced my 2-m air temperature (or any other) sensor; how do I tell Matlab to read multiple date ranges, one for each sensor?*

    * Use the `inputFileName` and `inputFileName_dates` parameters, with the syntax as in the following example, showing three different sensors with their respective date ranges:

    <pre>variableName = 'TA_1_1_1'
title = 'Air temperature at 2m (HMP)'
originalVariable = 'Air temperature at 2m (HMP)'
inputFileName = {'MET_HMP_T_2m_Avg','LI7700_Tair','MET_HMP155_2m'}
inputFileName_dates = [datenum(2010,1,1) datenum(2020,1,1);datenum(2020,1,1) datenum(2024,1,1);datenum(2024,1,1) datenum(2999,1,1)]
measurementType = 'met'
units = 'âˆžC'
instrument = 'HMP155A'
...</pre>

4. *How do I incorporate data from other sources such as nearby climate stations, e.g., for gap-filling, into my database?*

    * See section 5.2: subsection "Create Database Using Data from Canadian Meteorological Stations".

5. *When I run third stage cleaning, why does it finish so quickly (less than a minute), and/or why is there is no data output in the* `Database` *directory?*

    * Check the log file that is produced automatically when running the third stage (`SITEID1_ThirdStageCleaning.log`). It is informative and will usually tell you the issue; it is located here:

        <img src="images/directory_trees/DirectoryTree8.jpg" alt="ThirdStageLogFile" width="400"/>

        *Screenshot showing the location of the third stage log file.*

    * Check that all R packages are installed and loaded. Refer to the code provided in section 2.5 for this.

    * Check that after you downloaded and unzipped the `Biomet.net` library, you renamed it from `Biomet.net-main` to **`Biomet.net`**.

6. *Matlab cannot find R/Rscript on my computer, even though it is installed with the correct versions. How do I fix this?*

    * Create a function called `biomet_Rpath_default.m` and put it in your project Matlab folder. You can explicitly define the path to the Rscript executable file, like in the example below:

        *Mac example:*
        <pre>function folderR = biomet_Rpath_default
        folderR = '/usr/local/bin/Rscript';</pre>

        *Windows example:*
        <pre>function folderR = biomet_Rpath_default
        folderR = 'C:\Program Files\R\R-4.4.1\bin\Rscript.exe';</pre>

    * This can happen if R and/or Matlab are not both in "Program Files" folder, on Windows. 

7. *My raw eddy-covariance data has a frequency of 10 Hz (rather than 20 Hz): how do I tell the pipeline to utilize this information in the diagnostics, used records and file records?*

    * In your `SITEID1_FirstStage.ini` file, you can use global variables to overwrite diagnostic settings defined in include files (see section 5.3: subsection Global variables and include files), as follows:
    <pre>
    %--> For specifying minMax number of used records and file records depending on frequency, e.g.: 
    % Example: globalVars.Trace.used_records.minMax = [1500*frequency 1800*frequency] %(where frequency is typically 10 or 20 Hz)
    globalVars.Trace.used_records.minMax 					= [15000 18000] 
    globalVars.Trace.file_records.minMax 					= [15000 18000]</pre>

8. *Is there a fast way to check whether variables loaded into my database actually contain data (or if all data points are NaN)?*

    * Yes. Call the following function by giving it siteID, year, and cleaning stage number (1 or 2), and it will return the names of all traces from that stage that contain no other numbers but NaNs:
    <pre>cntAllNanFiles = findAllNaNfiles('DSM',2025,1);</pre>

    * Alternatively, you can just point it to a folder with database files without specifying anything else:
    <pre>cntAllNanFiles = findAllNaNfiles('E:\Pipeline_Projects\database\2024\DSM\Clean\SecondStage');</pre>

    * Sample output:
    <img src="images/matlab/findAllNaNfiles.jpg" alt="findAllNaNfiles" width="650"/>

### Special Cases

This section outlines some recurring special cases and how to deal with them:

1. *There is a variable defined in an include INI file that I have no raw input data for.* 

    In this case, you can add the following code to the global variables section of your first stage INI file. Remember to change the name of the "dummyVariable" to match the name of the variable you do not have.

    <pre>
    %-->Avoiding errors due to missing input files 
    dateRangeNoData = [datenum(1900,1,1) datenum(1900,12,31)]
    globalVars.Trace.dummyVariable.inputFileName_dates = dateRangeNoData</pre>
    E.g., if you are running data cleaning for the year 2023, this code essentially tells the pipeline that for this "dummyVariable", no data exists for 2023 (and only exists for the year 1900), and the program will continue smoothly with no errors.

2. *I am using an earlier version of Matlab than 2023b, and I'm getting an error when running the `create_TAB_ProjectFolders` function. How do I fix this?*
    
    Download <a href= "directory_setup/My_Micromet_Folder.zip">this zip file</a>, unzip, and put the *contents* of the unzipped directory within your own project directory; make sure your directory structure looks like figure 4.1 in section 4. 

    The `gitclone` Matlab function is used within the `create_TAB_ProjectFolders` function to transfer (clone) the directory structure and files within. However, `gitclone` was only added to Matlab 2023b, so you need to download this project directory structure directly.

    If it is an error related to `gitclone`, the error will occur on the line that gitclone is called, so you can check this in the error message, e.g., it may look like this:
    <pre>Error: <u>File: create_TAB_ProjectFolders.m Line: 66 Column: 32</u>
    Incorrect use of '=' operator. To assign a value to a variable, use '='. To compare values for equality, use '=='.</pre>

    <!--Ideally, you would update your Matlab version if possible, since we may make edits to the directory structure/set-up in the future... Not sure how we are handling this even for those using gitclone?? -->

3. *I am working on a Linux operating system and first stage cleaning crashes with an error unable to open the "Met" or "Flux" database folder, e.g.:*

    <pre>*** Error! File: ".../Database/2024/RBM/met/Clean/TA_1_1_1" cannot be opened!</pre>

    This is because the `measurementType` parameter in your first stage INI file has lower case. To fix this, make sure that you are using upper case for the `measurementType` parameter everywhere it appears in your first stage INI, e.g., `measurementType = 'Met'` or `measurementType = 'Flux'`.

4. *I am starting with a "clean" data set, for example from Ameriflux or ICOS. Is there a quick or generic way to create INI files directly from this data to get it into the pipeline to run third stage/gap-filling?*

    * Yes, we have a generic way of doing this, and one specifically designed for data downloaded from Ameriflux (BASE and BIF).
    
    * Usually, these input files have a small number of traces (<100) and they don't need to use our "include" files.

    * Once the INI files are created, they can be edited to include some additional cleaning or data manipulation. 

    *Generic solution:*
    
    * First convert the input (usually CSV) files to our database format (see sections 4.2/5.2).
    * Run the code below, after editing the inputs to match your site. In particular, make sure you get the siteID and the startYear right.

    <pre>
    startYear = 2021;
    siteID = 'mySite'
    GMT_offset = -8;

    % Set input parameters:
    structSetup.startYear = startYear;
    structSetup.startMonth = 1;
    structSetup.startDay = 1;
    structSetup.endYear = 2999;
    structSetup.endMonth = 12;
    structSetup.endDay = 31;
    structSetup.Site_name = 'Long name here';
    structSetup.siteID = siteID;
    structSetup.allMeasurementTypes = {'Flux'};
    structSetup.Difference_GMT_to_local_time = -GMT_offset;     % local+Difference_GMT_to_local_time -> GMT time
    structSetup.outputPath = [];                                % keep it in the local directory
    structSetup.isTemplate = false;                             % Set to false if you want to create 

    % create template:
    createFirstStageIni(structSetup)

    % SecondStage template:
    createSecondStageIni(structSetup)</pre>

    *Ameriflux solution:*

    * Edit site ID(s), data source path (where you put your downloaded Ameriflux data), and project path as necessary.

    <pre>
    % Convert Ameriflux BASE+BIF files into TAB database project
    
    % Example creating a new project with two sites:
    allNewSites = {'BR-Npw','CA-BOU'};
    dbID = 'AMF';
    sourcePath = 'E:\Pipeline_Projects\Ameriflux_raw';
    projectPath = 'E:\Pipeline_Projects\Ameriflux_CH4_v2'
    flagNewSites = false
    result = convertAmeriflux2TAB(allNewSites,dbID,sourcePath,projectPath,flagNewSites);</pre>

    <pre>% Example: adding a new site to an existing project
    allNewSites = {'CA-DSM'};
    dbID = 'AMF';
    sourcePath = 'E:\Pipeline_Projects\Ameriflux_raw';
    projectPath = 'E:\Pipeline_Projects\Ameriflux_CH4_v2'
    flagNewSites = true
    result = convertAmeriflux2TAB(allNewSites,dbID,sourcePath,projectPath,flagNewSites);</pre>

</div>
