## 2.5. &nbsp; Install R and RStudio on your local computer

<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">

As with all the other software installations for use in data cleaning, first check which versions are recommended at present.

* Installation instructions for R on Windows and Mac can be found here: <a href="https://cran.rstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cran.rstudio.com</a>.

* Installation instructions for RStudio on Windows and Mac: <a href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop</a>.

* Any packages that you need and do not already have will be automatically installed by our pipeline scripts.

* Next, install the following libraries in RStudio by running the code below. Note this code will only install packages that you don't already have installed:

<pre>
packages <- c("tidyverse", "caret", "REddyProc", "dplyr", "lubridate", "data.table", "fs", "yaml", "rlist", "zoo", "reshape2", "stringr", "ranger", "caret", "ggplot2")
  
installed_packages <- packages %in% rownames(installed.packages())
  if (any(installed_packages == FALSE)) {
    install.packages(packages[!installed_packages])
  }

</pre>
