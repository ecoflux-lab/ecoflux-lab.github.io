## 2.6. &nbsp; Python Installation on your local computer (optional)

This step is optional. Python can be used in a number of eddy covariance data packages (e.g., some of these <a href="https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/resources/resource-list/tools-and-software-for-flux-scientists/flux-data-post-processing-and-qa-qc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flux data post-processing and QA/QC resources</a>). 

Python is also necessary for those interested in running high-frequency data reprocessing described in this <a href="https://github.com/CANFLUX/EddyPro_API/blob/main/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EddyPro API</a> or gap-filling fluxes using the approach described in [the paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168192321002124) "Gap-filling eddy covariance methane fluxes: Comparison of machine learning model predictions and uncertainties at FLUXNET-CH4 wetlands".

However, you can skip this step if you do no plan to use any of the resources above.
